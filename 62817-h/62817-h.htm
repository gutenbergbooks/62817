  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> this volume I have endeavoured to write a history of Europe during
    an important period of transition. I have reduced military details to
    the smallest possible limits, and have preferred to mention rather
    than to describe battles and campaigns, in order to have more space
    to devote to such questions as the Belgian revolution of 1789, the
    reorganisation of Prussia in 1806–12, and the Congress of Vienna.
    I have throughout tried to describe the French Revolution in its
    influence on Europe, and Napoleon’s career as a great reformer rather
    than as a great conqueror. The inner meaning of the period and its
    general results I have sketched in a short introductory chapter, on
    which the rest of the volume is really a detailed historical commentary.</p>

  <p>The maps which accompany the volume are intended to show the changes
    in the boundaries of States, and not to give the position of places
    mentioned in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span> text. Every one who reads such a volume as the
    present must use an atlas as his constant companion, for no book of
    this size could possibly contain a sufficient number of maps adequate
    to the illustration of the events narrated.</p>

  <p>In conclusion, I must express my thanks to Mr. W. R. Morfill, Reader
    in Slavonic to the University of Oxford, for giving me a canon for
    the spelling of Russian proper names, and to the Editor, Mr. Arthur
    Hassall, for willing assistance and friendly encouragement.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">A Period of Transition.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> period from 1789 to 1815—that is, the era of the French Revolution
    and of the domination of Napoleon—marks one of the most important
    transitions in the history of Europe. Great as is the difference
    between the material condition of the Europe of the nineteenth century,
    with its railways and its electric telegraphs, and the Europe of the
    eighteenth century, with its bad roads and uncertain posts, it is not
    greater than the contrast between the political, social, and economical
    ideas which prevailed then and which prevail now. Modern principles,
    that mark a new departure in human progress and in its evidence,
    Civilisation, took their rise during this epoch of transition, and
    their development underlies the history of the period, and gives the
    key to its meaning.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Sovereignty of the People.</div>

  <p>The conception that government exists for the promotion of the
    security and prosperity of the governed was fully grasped in the
    eighteenth century. But it was held alike by philosophers <span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>and rulers,
    alike in civilised England and in Russia emerging from barbarism
    that, whilst government existed for the good of the people, it
    must not be administered by the people. This fundamental principle
    is in the nineteenth century entirely denied. It is now believed
    that the government should be directed by the people through their
    representatives, and that it is better for a nation to make mistakes
    in the course of its self-government than to be ruled, be it ever so
    wisely, by an irresponsible monarch. This notion of the sovereignty of
    the people was energetically propounded during the great Revolution in
    France. It is not yet universally accepted in all the states of modern
    Europe. But it has profoundly affected the political development of
    the nineteenth century. It lies at the base of one group of modern
    political ideas; and, though in 1815 it seemed to have been propounded
    only to be condemned, one of the most striking features of the modern
    history of Europe since the Congress of Vienna, has been its gradual
    acceptance and steady growth in civilised countries.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Principle of Nationality.</div>

  <p>The second political belief introduced during the epoch of transition
    from 1789 to 1815 was the recognition of the idea of nationality in
    contradistinction to that of the State, which prevailed in the last
    century. In the eighteenth century the State was typified by the
    ruling authority. National boundaries and race limits were regarded as
    of no importance. It was not felt to be an anomaly that the Catholic
    Netherlands or Belgium should be governed by the House of Austria,
    or that an Austrian prince should reign in Tuscany and a Spanish
    prince in Naples. The first partition of Poland was not condemned as
    an offence against nature, but as an artful scheme devised for the
    purpose of enlarging the neighbouring states, which had appropriated
    the districts lying nearest to their own territories. But during the
    wars of the Revolution and of Napoleon the idea of nationality made
    itself felt. France, as a nation in arms, proved to be more than a
    match for the Europe of the old <span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>conceptions. And it was not until her
    own sense of nationality was absorbed in Napoleon’s creation of a new
    Empire of the West that France was vanquished by coming in contact with
    the Spanish, the Russian, and the German peoples in the place of her
    former foes, the sovereigns of Europe. The idea of nationality, like
    the idea of the sovereignty of the people, seemed to be condemned in
    1815 by the Congress of Vienna. The Catholic Netherlands were united
    with the provinces of Holland; Norway was forcibly separated from
    Denmark; Italy was once more parcelled out into independent states
    under foreign princes. But the Congress of Vienna could not eradicate
    the new idea. It had taken too deep a root. And another striking
    feature of the European history of the nineteenth century has been the
    formation of new nations, resting their <i>raison d’être</i> on the feeling
    of nationality and the identity of race.</p>

 <div class="sidenote">The Principle of Personal Liberty.</div>

  <p>The third modern notion which has transformed Europe is the recognition
    of the principle of personal and individual liberty. Feudalism left the
    impress of its graduation of rights and duties marked deeply on the
    constitutions of the European States. The sovereignty of the people
    implies political liberty of action; feudalism denied the propriety and
    advantages of social and economical freedom. Theoretically, freedom
    of individual thought and action was acknowledged to be a good thing
    by all wise philosophers and rulers. Practically, the poorer classes
    were kept in bondage either as agricultural serfs by their lords or as
    journeymen workmen by the trade-guilds. Where personal and individual
    liberty had been attained, political liberty became an object of
    ambition, and political liberty led to the idea of the sovereignty of
    the people. The last vestiges of feudalism were swept away during this
    era of transition. The doctrines of the French Revolution did more
    than the victories of Napoleon to destroy the political system of the
    eighteenth century. The Congress of Vienna in 1815 might return to the
    former notions of government and the State, but it did <span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>not attempt
    to restore the old restrictions on individual liberty. With personal
    freedom acknowledged, the reactionary tendency of the Congress of
    Vienna was left of no effect. Liberty of thought and action led to the
    resurrection of the conceptions of nationality and of the sovereignty
    of the people, which were but for the moment extinguished by the defeat
    of France in the person of Napoleon by the armies of united Europe.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Benevolent Despots.</div>

  <p>The period which preceded the French Revolution and the era of
    war, from the troubles of which modern Europe was to be born, may
    be characterised as that of the benevolent despots. The State was
    everything; the nation nothing. The ruler was supreme, but his
    supremacy rested on the assumption that he ruled his subjects for their
    good. This conception of the <i>Aufgeklärte Despotismus</i> was developed
    to its highest degree by Frederick the Great of Prussia. ‘I am but the
    first servant of the nation,’ he wrote, a phrase which irresistibly
    recalls the definition of the position of Louis <span class="smcap">XVI.</span> by the
    first leaders of the French Revolution. This attitude was defended by
    great thinkers like Diderot, and is the keynote to the internal policy
    of the monarchs of the latter half of the eighteenth century towards
    their people. The Empress Catherine of Russia, Gustavus <span class="smcap">III.</span>
    of Sweden, Charles <span class="smcap">III.</span> of Spain, the Archduke Leopold of
    Tuscany, and, above all, the Emperor Joseph <span class="smcap">II.</span> defended their
    absolutism on the ground that they exercised their power for the good
    of their subjects. Never was more earnest zeal displayed in promoting
    the material well-being of all classes, never did monarchs labour
    so hard to justify their existence, or effect such important civil
    reforms, as on the eve of the French Revolution, which was to herald
    the overthrow of the doctrine of absolute monarchy. The intrinsic
    weakness of the position of the benevolent despots was that they could
    not ensure the permanence of their reforms, or vivify the rotten fabric
    of the administrative edifices, which had grown up in the feudal
    monarchies. Great ministers, such as Tanucci and Aranda, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>could do much
    to help their masters to carry out their benevolent ideas, but they
    could not form or nominate their successors, or create a perfect body
    of unselfish administrators. When Frederick the Great’s master hand was
    withdrawn, Prussia speedily exhibited a condition of administrative
    decay, and since this was the case in Prussia, which had been for more
    than forty years under the rule of the greatest and wisest of the
    benevolent despots, the falling-off was likely to be even more marked
    in other countries. The conception of benevolent despots ruling for
    their people’s good was eventually superseded, as was certain to be the
    case, owing to the impossibility of their ensuring its permanence, by
    the modern idea of the people ruling themselves.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Condition of the Labouring Classes.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Serfdom.</div>

  <p>And, in truth, while doing full justice to the sentiments and the
    endeavours of the benevolent despots, it cannot honestly be said that
    their efforts had done much to improve the condition of the labouring
    classes by the end of the eighteenth century. The great majority of
    the peasants of Europe were throughout that century absolute serfs. To
    take once more the example of Prussia, the only attempts to improve
    the condition of the peasants had been made in the royal domain, and
    they had only been very tentative. The dwellers on the estates of the
    Prussian nobility in Silesia and Brandenburg were treated no better
    than negro slaves in America and the West Indies. They were not allowed
    to leave their villages, or to marry without their lords’ consent;
    their children had to serve in the lords’ families for several years at
    a nominal wage, and they themselves had to labour at least three days,
    and often six days, a week on their lords’ estate. These <i>corvées</i> or
    forced labours occupied so much of the peasant’s time that he could
    only cultivate his own farm by moonlight. This state of absolute
    serfdom was general in Central and Eastern Europe, in the greater part
    of Germany, in Poland and in Russia, and where it existed the artisan
    class was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span> equally depressed, for no man was allowed to learn a trade
    without his lord’s permission, and an escaped serf had no chance of
    admission into the trade-guilds of the cities. Towards the west a
    more advanced civilisation improved the condition of the labourers;
    the Italian peasant and the German peasant on the Rhine had obtained
    freedom to marry without his lord’s interference; but, nevertheless, it
    was a leading prince on the Rhine, the Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel, who
    sold his subjects to England to serve as mercenaries in the American
    War of Independence. In France the peasant was far better off. The only
    serfs left, who existed on the domain of the Abbey of Saint-Claude
    in the Jura, on whose behalf Voltaire wielded his powerful pen, were
    in a far happier condition than the German serfs; they could marry
    whom they pleased; they might emigrate without leave; their persons
    were free; all they were deprived of was the power of selling their
    property or devising it by will. The rest of the French peasants
    and the agricultural classes generally were extremely independent.
    Feudalism had left them some annoyances but few real grievances, and
    the inconveniences they suffered were due solely to the inequalities
    of the copyhold system of tenure and its infringements of their
    personal liberty. The French peasants and farmers were indignant at an
    occasional day’s <i>corvée</i>, or forced labour, which really represented
    the modern rent, and at the succession-duties they had to pay the
    descendants or representatives of their ancestors’ feudal lords. The
    German, Polish, and Hungarian peasant, on the contrary, crushed beneath
    the burden of his personal servitude, did not dream of pretending to
    own the plot of land, which his lord kindly allowed him to cultivate in
    his few spare moments.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Middle Classes.</div>

  <p>The mass of the population of Central and Eastern Europe was purely
    agricultural, and in its poverty expected naught but the bare
    necessaries of existence. Trade, commerce, and manufactures were
    therefore practically non-existent. This meant that the cities,
    and consequently the middle classes, formed but an insignificant
    factor in the population. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span> the West of Europe, on the Rhine, and
    more especially in France, where the agricultural classes were more
    independent, more wealthy, and more civilised, existence demanded more
    comforts, and a well-to-do and intelligent commercial and manufacturing
    urban element quickly developed to supply the demand created. Commerce,
    trade, and the concentrated employment of labour produced a prosperous
    and enlightened middle class, accustomed for generations to education
    and the possession of personal freedom. With wealth always goes
    civilisation and education, and as there was a larger middle class in
    France and Western Germany than in Central and Eastern Europe, the
    peasants in those parts were better educated and more intelligent.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Upper Classes.</div>

  <p>The condition of the upper classes followed the same geographical
    distribution. The highest aristocracy of all European countries was
    indeed, as it has always been, on much the same intellectual and social
    level. Paris was its centre, the capital of society, fashion, and
    luxury, where Russian, Austrian, Swedish, and English nobles met on an
    equality. But the bulk of the German and Eastern European aristocracy
    was in education and refinement inferior to the bulk of the French
    nobility. Yet they possessed an authority which the French nobility had
    lost. The Russian, Prussian, and Austrian nobleman and the Hungarian
    magnate was the owner of thousands of serfs, who cultivated his lands
    and rendered him implicit obedience. The French nobleman exacted only
    certain rents, either copyhold quit-rents or feudal services, from the
    tenants on his ancestral estates. His tenants were in no sense his
    serfs; they owed him no personal service, and resented the payment
    of the rent substituted for such service. The patriarchal feeling of
    loyalty to the lord had long disappeared, and the French peasant did
    not acknowledge any subjection to his landlord, while the Prussian and
    Russian serf recognised his bondage to his master.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Why France experienced the Revolution.</div>

  <p>These considerations help to show why the Revolution, which was after
    twenty-six years to inaugurate modern Europe,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span> broke out in France. It
    was because the French peasant was more independent, more wealthy, and
    better educated than the German serf, that he resented the political
    and social privileges of his landlord and the payment of rent, more
    than the serf objected to his bondage. It was because France possessed
    an enlightened middle class that the peasants and workmen found
    leaders. It was because Frenchmen had been in the possession of a great
    measure of personal freedom that they were ready to strike a blow
    for political liberty, and eventually promulgated the idea of social
    equality. The ideas of the sovereignty of the people, of nationality
    and of personal liberty, did not originate in France. They are as
    old as civilisation. But they had been clouded in the Middle Ages by
    feudalism, and, after the Reformation, had been succeeded by different
    political conceptions, which had crystallised in the eighteenth century
    into the doctrines of the supremacy of the State, of the arbitrary rule
    of benevolent or enlightened despots. England and Holland had developed
    separately from the rest of the Western World. For reasons lying deep
    in their internal history and their geographical position, they had rid
    themselves alike of feudalism and absolute monarchy; they had developed
    a sense of their independent nationality, and had recognised the
    importance of personal freedom. In England especially, the abolition
    of the relics of feudalism in the seventeenth century had placed the
    English farmers and peasants in a different economical position from
    their fellows on the Continent. There existed in England none of the
    invidious distinctions between nobleman and <i>roturier</i> in the matter
    of bearing national burdens, which had survived in France, and, though
    owing to the curiosities of the franchise the larger proportion of
    Englishmen had but a very small share in electing the representatives
    of the people, the government carried on as it was by a small oligarchy
    of great families possessed an appearance of political liberty, and of
    a wisely-balanced machine for administrative purposes.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Intellectual movement of the eighteenth century.</div>

  <p>Nor must the influence of intellectual ideas, as bearing on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span> problems
    which the French Revolution was to force on the attention of the more
    backward and more oppressed nations of Europe, be underrated. The
    great French writers of the eighteenth century—Voltaire, Montesquieu,
    Diderot, and Rousseau—had been deeply impregnated with the ideas of
    Locke and the English political thinkers of his school. In their
    different lines they insisted that government existed for the good
    of the governed, and investigated the origins of government and the
    relations of man in the social state. It was their speculations which
    altered the character of absolute monarchy and based its retention on
    its benevolent purposes; they, too, insisted upon the rights of man to
    preserve his personal freedom, as long as it did not clash with the
    maintenance and security of civil society. The great French writers of
    the eighteenth century exercised by their works a smaller influence on
    the outbreak and actual course of the French Revolution than has been
    generally supposed. The causes of the movement were chiefly economical
    and political, not philosophical or social: its rapid development was
    due to historical circumstances, and mainly to the attitude of the
    rest of Europe. But the text-books of its leaders were the works of
    the French thinkers of the eighteenth century, and if their doctrines
    had little actual influence in bringing about the Revolution, they
    influenced its development and the extension of its principles
    throughout Europe. It is curious to contrast the opinions of the great
    French writers of the middle of the eighteenth century, whose arguments
    mainly affected the general conceptions of man living in society,
    that is, of government, with the views advocated by the great German
    writers of the end of the century, who concentrated their attention
    upon man in his individual capacity for culture and self-improvement.
    Schiller, Goethe, Kant, and Herder were, further, more cosmopolitan
    than German. The problems of man and his intellectual and artistic
    development proved more attractive to the great German thinkers than
    the difficulties presented by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span> economical, social, and political
    diversities of different classes of society. Goethe, for instance,
    understood the signification of the French Revolution, and was much
    interested in its effects on the human race, but he cared very little
    about its impression on Germany.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Morality and Religion in the eighteenth century.</div>

  <p>Finally, the low state of morality in the eighteenth century had sapped
    the earnestness in the cause of humanity of men of all classes in all
    countries. Disbelief in the Christian religion was general in both the
    Protestant and Catholic countries of the Continent. The immorality
    of most of the prelates in Catholic countries was notorious, and was
    equalled by their avowed contempt for the doctrines of the religion
    they professed to teach. The Protestant pastors of Germany were quite
    as open in their infidelity. In the famous case of Schulz, the pastor
    of Gielsdorf, who openly denied Christianity, and taught simply that
    morality was necessary, the High Consistory of Berlin held that he was,
    nevertheless, still fitted to hold his office as the Lutheran pastor of
    his village. Christianity in both Catholic and Protestant countries was
    replaced by the vague sentiments of morality, which are best presented
    in Rousseau’s <i>Profession de Foi du Vicaire Savoyard</i>. In reaction to
    this vague and dogmaless morality, there existed many secret societies
    and coteries of mystics, such as the Rosati and the Illuminati, who
    replaced religion by ornate and symbolical ceremonies.</p>

  <p>Such was the political, economical, intellectual and moral state
    of Europe in 1789, on the eve of the French Revolution. The whole
    continent was to pass through twenty-six years of almost unceasing
    war, at the end of which it was to emerge with new conceptions and new
    ideals of both political and social life. The new ideas seemed indeed
    to be checked, if not destroyed, in 1815, but once inspired into men’s
    minds they could not be forgotten, and their subsequent development
    forms the history of modern Europe in the nineteenth century.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Treaty of 1756.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> states of Europe at the commencement of the year 1789 were ranked
    diplomatically in two important groups, the one dominated by the
    connection between France, Austria, Spain, and Russia; the other
    by the alliance between England, Prussia, and Holland. The great
    transformation which had been effected by the treaty between France
    and Austria in 1756 in the relationship between the powers of Europe
    was the crowning diplomatic event of the eighteenth century. The
    arrangements then entered into and the alliances tested in the Seven
    Years’ War still subsisted in 1789. But the spirit which lay at the
    root of the Austro-French alliance was sensibly modified. The Treaty
    of 1756 had never been really popular in either country. In France,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
    Marie Antoinette, whose marriage with Louis <span class="smcap">XVI.</span> had set the
    seal on the Austrian alliance, was detested as the living symbol of the
    hated treaty, as <i>l’Autrichienne</i>, the Austrian woman, and the most
    accredited political thinkers and writers were always dwelling on the
    traditional policy of France, and on the system of Henri <span class="smcap">IV.</span>,
    Richelieu, and Louis <span class="smcap">XIV.</span>, which held the House of Hapsburg
    to be the hereditary and the inevitable enemy of the House of Bourbon
    and of the French nation. The dislike of the alliance was felt with
    equal intensity in Austria by the wealthy and the educated classes. The
    Austrian generals resented the inefficacy of the French intervention
    during the Seven Years’ War, and the Austrian people attributed its
    reverses in that war to it with as much acrimony as if France had acted
    as an enemy instead of as an ally. The same sentiment actuated even
    the Imperial House. ‘Our natural enemies, travestied as allies, who do
    more harm than if they were open enemies;’<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> such is the language in
    which Leopold of Tuscany, brother of Marie Antoinette, characterised
    the French in a letter written in December 1784 to his brother, the
    Emperor Joseph <span class="smcap">II.</span> The Emperor Joseph was himself of the same
    opinion. He preferred his Russian ally, the Empress Catherine, to his
    brother-in-law, Louis <span class="smcap">XVI.</span>, King of France, and the tendency
    of his foreign policy was to strengthen his friendship with Russia,
    even at the expense of sacrificing his alliance with France. Russia,
    whose expansion under the great Empress had been enormous since the
    conclusion of the Seven Years’ War, cared but little for either of the
    allies, and pursued independently its course of steady development.
    Catherine had, indeed, during most of the later years of Frederick
    the Great, remained in alliance with Prussia, and to some extent had
    been on friendly terms with England. But her natural tendency was to
    distrust England. In 1780 she had placed herself at the head of the
    ‘Armed Neutrality,’ which opposed the naval pretensions <span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>of England,
    and in 1788 she had formally proposed a close quadruple alliance
    between Russia, Austria, France, and Spain.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Prussia, England, and Holland.</div>

  <p>If the relations between France, Russia, and Austria were unsettled,
    the Triple Alliance between Prussia, Holland, and England was hardly on
    a more stable footing in 1789. Prussia, since the death of Frederick
    the Great, had become really decrepit, while apparently remaining a
    first-rate military power. Though still preserving the prestige of
    its famous King, who died in 1786, and recognising its alliance with
    England, Prussia in 1789 exhibited a decaying internal administration,
    and a vacillating foreign policy. England had received a heavy blow by
    the success of the colonists in North America, and by the Treaty of
    Versailles, and the powers of the Continent, while envying her wealth,
    held her military power of but small account. This opinion prevailed
    even at Berlin, and the new King of Prussia gave many evidences that
    the alliance of England was rather distasteful to him than otherwise.
    The third member of the alliance, Holland, was in the weakest condition
    of all, and it was only by invoking the armed interference of Prussia
    that England had maintained the authority of the Prince of Orange, as
    Stadtholder, in 1787. Though this interference had led to the formation
    of the famous Triple Alliance of 1788, in reality the English and
    Prussian statesmen profoundly distrusted each other, while the forcing
    of the yoke of the Stadtholder upon them caused the Dutch democratic
    party in Holland to abhor the allies and to look for help to France.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Minor Powers of Europe.</div>

  <p>The rest of the European states were bound more or less firmly to
    the one or the other of the two coalitions. The smaller states of
    Germany, aggravated or intimidated by the measures of the Emperor
    Joseph <span class="smcap">II.</span>, had rallied to the side of Prussia. In the north,
    Denmark, whose reigning house was connected by family ties with the
    royal families of England and Prussia, was completely under Russian
    influence, while Sweden, under Gustavus <span class="smcap">III.</span>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span> was actually at
    war with Catherine <span class="smcap">II.</span> Poland, torn by internal dissensions,
    and threatened with complete destruction by its neighbours, was
    awaiting its final partition. The southern states of Europe were almost
    entirely bound to the Franco-Austrian alliance. Spain had been united
    to France by the offensive and defensive treaty, known as the ‘Pacte
    de Famille,’ concluded by the French minister, Choiseul, in 1761, and
    tested in the war of American Independence. Portugal, though connected
    with England, commercially by the Methuen treaty, and politically by
    a long course of protection against Spanish pretensions, was striving
    by a series of royal marriages to become the ally of Spain. In Italy,
    Naples was ruled by a Spanish prince married to an Austrian princess;
    Sardinia was closely allied with France, and the remainder of the
    peninsula was mainly under Austrian influence. Turkey, now travelling
    towards decay, was looked upon by Russia and Austria as their
    legitimate prey, and met with encouragement in resistance, but not with
    active help, from England and France.</p>

  <p>After thus roughly sketching the general attitude of the powers of
    Europe to each other in 1789, it will be well to examine each state
    separately before entering on the history of the exciting period which
    followed. Great and sweeping alterations were to be effected; many
    diplomatic variations were to take place. The most important result of
    the period of the French Revolution and of Napoleon was its influence
    upon the minds of men, as shown in the growth of certain political
    conceptions, which have moulded modern Europe. But great changes were
    also brought about in dynasties and in the geographical boundaries of
    states, which can only be understood by a knowledge of the condition of
    Europe in 1789.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Austria: Joseph II.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Joseph II.: Internal Policy.</div>

  <p>The figure of most importance in the beginning of the year 1789 was
    that of the Emperor Joseph <span class="smcap">II.</span>, and his dominions were those
    in which an observer would have prophesied a great revolution. Joseph
    was at that date a man of forty-seven; he had been elected Emperor in
    the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span> place of his father, Francis of Lorraine, in 1765, and succeeded
    to the hereditary dominions of the House of Austria on the death
    of his mother, Maria Theresa, in 1780. He was, perhaps, the best
    type of the class of benevolent despots. A singularly industrious,
    enlightened, and able ruler, his ideas were far in advance of those of
    his age,—so much in advance, indeed, that his efforts to impose them
    upon his subjects brought upon himself hatred instead of gratitude,
    and among the people turbulence and insurrection instead of peace and
    tranquillity. The history of the Emperor Joseph’s reforms, and of the
    disturbances which resulted from them, belongs to an earlier volume of
    this series. In 1789 the whole of the hereditary dominions of the House
    of Hapsburg were in a state of ferment. The Emperor’s scheme of welding
    them into an Austrian nation, by insisting on the use of the German
    language, by simplifying the state of the law and the administration,
    and assimilating the various religious and educational institutions,
    had roused the fire of local patriotism. In Hungary and in the Tyrol,
    in Bohemia, and, above all, in the Austrian Netherlands, or Belgium,
    there was declared rebellion, fanned by local prejudices, religious
    fanaticism, and the spirit of caste. The first and second of these
    causes were chiefly responsible in the Austrian Netherlands, the third
    in Hungary. The Belgians, and more especially the Brabançons, were in
    arms for their local rights and ancient constitutions, which had been
    infringed by the Emperor’s decrees. The Belgian clergy, who looked upon
    Joseph as worse than an infidel for his treatment of the Pope and his
    suppression of religious houses, were inflamed at the establishment
    of an Imperial Seminary in Brussels as a rival to the Roman Catholic
    University of Louvain. But in Hungary it was the magnates of the
    country who had fought so gallantly for Maria Theresa and saved her
    throne, who were in an attitude of open disaffection. This was partly
    due to Joseph’s infringement of their Constitution and his removal of
    the Iron Crown to Vienna, but still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span> more to his abolition of serfdom.
    As has been already stated, serfdom in Europe was practically extinct
    in the western part of the Continent, that is, in France, in Belgium,
    and on the Rhine, while it increased in intensity steadily towards
    the east, and was as bad in Prussia Proper, Poland, and Hungary, as
    in Russia. ‘Most merciful Emperor,’ ran a petition from an Hungarian
    peasant to Joseph, ‘four days’ forced labour for the seigneur; the
    fifth day, fishing for him; the sixth day, hunting with him; and the
    seventh belongs to God. Consider, most merciful Emperor, how can I
    pay dues and taxes?’<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The iniquity of serfdom, with its practice of
    forced labour, was accentuated in Hungary by the constitutional custom
    which exempted the nobility from all taxation. The Emperor Joseph
    abolished serfdom in Hungary on 22nd August 1785, and inaugurated a
    system of removing feudal burdens, and converting forced labour, by
    means of a gradually diminishing tax. The condition of the hereditary
    dominions of the House of Hapsburg was thus, in 1789, one of seething
    discontent where it was not open rebellion; Belgian burghers and
    Hungarian magnates were alike infuriated by the Emperor’s efforts at
    reform; and the poor serfs of Hungary and Bohemia and the working men
    of Belgium, whom he designed to benefit by direct legislation and
    financial measures, were too weak to render him any help. His hope of
    creating an Austrian state and an Austrian people out of his scattered
    dominions was fated to be thwarted; obstacles of distance, race, and
    language, cannot be overcome by legislation, however wise; and the
    Emperor’s well-intentioned endeavours nearly lost his House its ancient
    patrimony.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Joseph II. Foreign Policy.</div>

  <p>The foreign policy of the Emperor Joseph <span class="smcap">II.</span> was dictated by
    the same leading principle as his internal reforms—the desire to form
    his various territories into a compact state. His schemes to exchange
    the Austrian Netherlands for <span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>Bavaria in order to unite his possessions
    in Swabia with the nucleus of the Hapsburg territories were frustrated
    by the policy of Frederick the Great. His attempt to make his authority
    as Emperor more than nominal, and to create a real German empire based
    on a German patriotic feeling, proved an utter failure. Foiled in these
    two projects, the creation of an Austrian compact state, which he
    deemed practicable, and the resurrection of a mighty Germany under his
    headship, which he acknowledged to be but a dream, Joseph <span class="smcap">II.</span>
    turned his thoughts towards Russia. The ideal of his early manhood
    had been his mother’s foe, Frederick the Great of Prussia; the ideal
    of his later years was the Empress Catherine of Russia. Both were
    specimens of the enlightened despots of the age; both had extended the
    realms they ruled; both endeavoured to form their states into compact
    entities; both had succeeded in administration and in war; and both
    were cynical disciples of the eighteenth-century philosophers. They
    were successively his models. It is characteristic of the Emperor
    Joseph <span class="smcap">II.</span> that the only picture in his private cabinet in
    the Hofburg at Vienna was a portrait of Frederick; the only picture in
    his bedroom one of Catherine. After the death of Frederick the Great,
    the Emperor Joseph <span class="smcap">II.</span>, despising his successor, expressed
    more loudly his admiration for Catherine. In 1787 he accompanied her
    in her famous progress to the Crimea. Fascinated by her personality
    and dazzled by her projects, the Emperor was persuaded to ally himself
    with Russia against the Turks, and hoped to partition Turkey with her,
    as his mother, Frederick, and Catherine had accomplished the first
    partition of Poland. In 1788 he accordingly declared war against the
    Sublime Porte. But he found that the Turks, in spite of the corruption
    of their government, were still no contemptible foes. His own army was
    demoralised by the misconduct of the aristocratic officers; disease
    decimated his troops; and the Emperor Joseph returned from the campaign
    of 1788 with the seeds of mortal illness in his system, but with his
    determination to pursue the war unabated.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span></p>

  <div class="sidenote">Russia: Catherine.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Poland.</div>

  <p>Russia, the chosen ally of Joseph <span class="smcap">II.</span>, was in 1789 ruled by
    the Empress Catherine <span class="smcap">II.</span> This great monarch, though by birth
    a princess of the petty German state of Anhalt-Zerbst, ranks with
    Peter the Great as a founder of the Russian Empire; more Russian than
    the Russians, she understood the importance of the development of her
    adopted country geographically towards the Baltic and the Black Sea,
    and the capacity of her people to support her in her enterprises.
    She was at this time sixty years of age, in full possession of her
    remarkable powers, and having ruled for twenty-seven years, she had
    fortified her authority by experience. Peter the Great had seen the
    absolute necessity that the Russian Empire should have access to the
    sea, and had built Saint Petersburg; Catherine had moved southward and
    extended her dominions to the Black Sea. She hoped to make the Baltic
    and the Black Sea Russian lakes, and on that account was the consistent
    and watchful enemy of Sweden and the Turks. Upon the western frontier
    of Russia lay Poland. The natural policy of Russia was to maintain and
    even to strengthen Poland as a buffer between Russia and the military
    powers of Austria and Prussia. But the extraordinary Constitution
    of Poland, which provided for the election of a powerless king, and
    recognised the right of civil war and the power of any nobleman to
    forbid any measure proposed at the Diet by the exercise of what was
    called the <i>liberum veto</i>, kept the unfortunate country in a state
    of anarchy, unable either to defend or to oppose. It might have been
    possible to reform the Constitution, and make the Poles an organised
    nation, but the neighbouring monarchs considered it easier to share
    the country amongst them, and had, under the guidance of Frederick
    the Great, carried out in 1772 the first partition, which excluded
    Poland from the sea, brought the borders of the three powers, Austria,
    Prussia, and Russia, nearer to each other, and caused Russia to become
    an European instead of essentially an Eastern monarchy. Catherine
    grasped the fact that in her present position Russia must intervene in
    European politics,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span> owing to the condition of Poland, and decided to
    derive what benefit she could from this circumstance. In her internal
    government Catherine was one of the benevolent despots. The patroness
    of Diderot, she expressed her admiration for the new doctrines of the
    Rights of Man, and even summoned a convention to draw up a Russian
    constitution. But she knew that the new doctrines were not applicable
    to the Russian people, and would be absurdly inappropriate to the nomad
    Tartar tribes which wandered over the southern districts of the Russian
    Empire. She was fully aware that their village organisation protected
    the peasants from many of the evils which prevailed in seemingly more
    enlightened countries, and gave them a right and interest in the soil
    to which they were attached. Russia, in fact, had experienced no
    Reformation, no Renaissance, no awakening of the ideas of individual
    and political liberty, and therefore was eminently fitted for the rule
    of a benevolent despot.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">France: Louis XVI.</div>

  <p>Next to the Austro-Russian alliance, the Austro-French alliance,
    sealed by the Treaty of 1756, was of the greatest significance to the
    peace and welfare of Europe in 1789. As has been said, in neither
    country was the alliance popular; France and Austria were hereditary
    enemies; classical policy in both courts favoured a resumption of this
    enmity; the friendship was rather dynastic than national, the work of
    Kaunitz and Maria Theresa, the Abbé de Bernis, Madame de Pompadour,
    and Louis <span class="smcap">XV.</span> France still appeared a very powerful nation.
    Its intervention in the American War of Independence had largely
    contributed to England’s loss of her American colonies, and the
    Treaty of Versailles in 1783 had involved a confession that England
    was beaten by her cession of the West India islands of St. Lucia and
    Tobago. But in spite of her seeming power, France was from political
    and economic causes really very weak. She had been unable in 1787
    to effectually support the republican and French party in Holland,
    and had been forced to allow England and Prussia to reinstate the
    Stadtholder, the Prince of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span> Orange. In spite of her alliance with
    Austria, she had been obliged in pursuance of a peace policy, made
    necessary by her financial condition, to draw near to England, and had
    made a commercial treaty with her in 1786. The weakness of France arose
    from internal circumstances. The State and the Court were financially
    identical. The Court was extravagant, and the result was a chronic
    national deficit. Efforts had been made to meet this deficit, but
    all expedients, even partial bankruptcy, had failed. It was evident
    that a systematic attempt must be made to rearrange the finances by
    introducing a regular scheme of taxation to take the place of the
    feudal arrangements for filling the royal treasury, which with some
    modifications still survived. But a regular scheme of taxation, which
    should abolish feudal privileges, and make the government responsible
    to the nation for its expenditure, could not be established without the
    consent of the people, and the educated classes, who were both numerous
    and prosperous, claimed a voice in its establishment. The feeling of
    political discontent went deeper. The French people had outgrown their
    system of government; the peasants and farmers resented the existence
    of the economic, social, and political privileges dating from the
    Middle Ages, which had survived the duties originally accompanying
    them; the bourgeois argued that they should have a share in regulating
    the affairs of the State; the educated classes sympathised with
    both. The day for benevolent despotism was over in France; Louis
    <span class="smcap">XVI.</span> was benevolent in disposition, but too weak to reform the
    system under which he ruled; and it was the system, not the person of
    the monarch, which the French people disliked; it was the system as a
    whole which they had outgrown.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Spain: Charles IV.</div>

  <p>Much of the strength of France rested on its intimate alliance with
    Spain. The two great Bourbon houses had been closely united by the
    ‘Pacte de Famille’ concluded in 1761, which bound them in an offensive
    and defensive alliance. Spain had loyally fulfilled her part of the
    bargain, and had suffered much in the War of American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span> Independence
    against England. Spain had had the good fortune to be ruled by one of
    the most enlightened of the benevolent despots, Charles <span class="smcap">III.</span>,
    whose minister, Aranda, was one of the greatest statesmen of his
    century. Aranda is best known from his persecution of the Jesuits, who
    had spread their influence over the minds of the Spanish people so
    far as to be the dictators of education and opinion. Their expulsion
    contributed to the power of the Crown, which undertook the direction
    of every form of national energy. Aranda was a great administrator;
    he spent vast sums on the improvement of communications and on public
    works, and he built up a powerful Spanish navy. The two evils which
    had depressed the fame of Spain, the personal lethargy of the people,
    due to the stamping out of liberty of thought by the Inquisition, and
    the poverty, caused by the influx of gold from the Spanish colonies,
    which prevented any encouragement of national industry, were however
    too great for any administrator to subdue, without a national uprising
    and the development of a national love for liberty. Aranda was ably
    helped by Campomanes, who founded a national system of education to
    take the place of the Jesuits’ schools and colleges, by Jovellanos, a
    great jurist and political economist, by Cabarrus, a skilful financier,
    who founded the bank of St. Charles, and developed a system of national
    credit, and by Florida Blanca, who superintended the department of
    foreign affairs, and succeeded Aranda in supreme power in 1774. Charles
    <span class="smcap">III.</span> died on 12th December 1788, and his successor, Charles
    <span class="smcap">IV.</span>, whose weakness of character was manifested throughout
    the period from 1789 to 1815, commenced his reign by maintaining
    Florida Blanca at the head of Spanish affairs, with Cabarrus and other
    experienced ministers.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Portugal: Maria I.</div>

  <p>Portugal was the intimate ally of England as Spain was of France. The
    hereditary connection of Portugal and England dated back for many
    centuries, and had been strengthened by the Methuen Treaty in 1703,
    which had made Portugal largely dependent on England.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span> The great
    Portuguese minister, Pombal, who had commenced the persecution of
    the Jesuits and had effected internal and administrative reforms,
    comparable to those of Aranda in Spain, had been disgraced in 1777,
    but the offices of State were filled by his pupils and managed on the
    principle, which he had initiated, of advancing the prosperity of the
    people. Pombal, while holding the strongest views on the importance
    of maintaining the royal absolutism, believed in the modern doctrines
    of reform; he had abolished slavery, encouraged education, and in
    the received ideas of political economy had encouraged by means of
    protection manufactures and agriculture. The essential weakness of
    Portugal rested, like that of Spain, on the exhaustion and consequent
    lethargy of its people; the Jesuits and the Inquisition had stamped out
    freedom of thought. Financially, also, its condition resembled that
    of Spain, for the sovereign derived such wealth from Brazil as to be
    independent of taxes, levied on the people. Politically the aim of the
    House of Braganza, during the latter part of the eighteenth century,
    had been to endeavour to free itself from dependence on England by
    uniting closely through inter-marriages with the reigning family in
    Spain. Queen Maria <span class="smcap">I.</span>, who had succeeded Joseph, the patron of
    Pombal, in 1777, was a fanatical lady of weak intellect, and in 1789
    the royal power was in the hands of the heir-apparent, Prince John, who
    was recognised as Regent some years later, and eventually succeeded to
    the throne in 1816, as John <span class="smcap">VI.</span></p>

  <p>Italy, in the eighteenth century, was composed of a number of small
    states. The idea of Italian unity lived only in the minds of the great
    Italian writers and thinkers; it met with no support from the powers
    of Europe. Italy was still the home of music and the arts, which
    were fostered by the numerous small Courts; but politically, owing
    to its subdivision, it hardly counted as a power, and its diplomacy
    had little weight in the European State system. It was entirely under
    the influence of France and Austria, and showed the tendencies of the
    century in the good government<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span> of most of the petty rulers. The most
    important of the Italian states was the kingdom of the Two Sicilies,
    which comprised the southern part of the peninsula and the island
    of Sicily. The kingdom had been granted to Ferdinand <span class="smcap">IV.</span>,
    when his father, the celebrated Don Carlos, succeeded as Charles
    <span class="smcap">III.</span> to the throne of Spain in 1759. It was in Naples that
    Charles <span class="smcap">III.</span> had commenced his career as a reforming monarch,
    and the great Neapolitan minister, Tanucci, continued to administer the
    affairs of the kingdom in a most enlightened fashion during the early
    years of the new monarch’s reign. His policy was to check the feudal
    instincts of the Neapolitan barons, whom he deprived of the lucrative
    right of administering justice, and thus to strengthen the influence
    of the Crown; and he also opposed the pretensions of the Pope, and
    concurred in the suppression of the Jesuits. The power thus acquired
    for the Crown was wisely used; the financial system was revised,
    education was encouraged, and an attempt was made to procure a general
    reform of the laws. The young publicist, Filangieri, whose <i>Science
      of Legislation</i> contained the most enlightened views on political
    economy and government, and who ranks next to Montesquieu as a typical
    political thinker of the eighteenth century, was a Neapolitan, and
    his speculations largely influenced the current of Italian thought.
    Sicily, however, remained to a great extent untouched by the influence
    of the great Neapolitan minister owing to its insular jealousy and the
    maintenance of its mediæval parliament. Ferdinand <span class="smcap">IV.</span>, in
    1768, married Maria Carolina, the ablest daughter of the Empress Maria
    Theresa, who at once assumed the most entire sway over her ill-educated
    and indolent husband. She secured the dismissal of Tanucci, whom she
    disliked on much the same grounds that her sister, Marie Antoinette,
    disliked the reforming French ministers, Turgot and Necker, in 1776,
    and after an interval replaced him by Acton, a native of France of
    Irish descent, who, owing to the temper of his patroness, was not able
    to continue efficiently the work of Tanucci. The States of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span> Church,
    including the Legations of Bologna and Ferrara and the principalities
    of Benevento and Ponte Corvo, were also governed in accordance with the
    enlightened ideas of the eighteenth century. The Papacy had much fallen
    in influence, and had been forced to comply with the demands of Pombal,
    Choiseul, Aranda, and Tanucci for the suppression of its spiritual
    mainstay, the order of the Jesuits; but it nevertheless maintained its
    temporal sovereignty in Italy. Giovanni Angelo Braschi, who had been
    elected Pope in 1775, and taken the title of Pius <span class="smcap">VI.</span>, was a
    man of singular ability and courtly manners. But he had to assent to
    vast reforms in Tuscany, which seriously affected the wealth of the
    Church in that part of the country, and had been unable, in spite of
    a personal visit to Vienna, to persuade Joseph <span class="smcap">II.</span> to alter
    his policy towards the Papacy. His most notable internal measures in
    the Papal States were the draining of the Pontine marshes, and his
    reconstitution of the Clementine Museum at Rome, which he placed under
    the charge of the eminent antiquary, Ennius Quirinus Visconti. Tuscany
    flourished under the rule of the Grand Duke Leopold, brother and
    eventual successor of Joseph <span class="smcap">II.</span>, the ablest administrator of
    all the benevolent despots. His reforms extended in every direction;
    with the help of Scipio de Ricci, Bishop of Pistoia, he reduced the
    number of bishoprics and monasteries; he drained many of the marshes,
    and so benefited agriculture; he reorganised education and encouraged
    the Universities of Pisa and Siena. But his greatest reforms were
    legal and economic. Tuscany having originated from a number of
    mediæval republics, had been hitherto administered as a collection of
    semi-independent cities and districts, with their own laws and local
    finances. Leopold was one of the first monarchs to project a uniform
    code of laws for his state, which he intrusted to the great jurist,
    Lampredi, to compile, and he abolished all personal privileges before
    the law, torture, the right of asylum for malefactors, confiscation of
    the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span> property of condemned malefactors, and secret denunciations. In
    economics he was the pupil of the French physiocrats, and the friend of
    the Marquis de Mirabeau, the ‘Ami des hommes,’ and in consonance with
    their doctrines he swept away all the internal customs duties and other
    restrictions on industry and commerce. Lastly, Leopold, seeing that
    his state was not strong enough to carry on a real war, abolished the
    Tuscan army, to the great advantage of his finances. Next to Tuscany,
    the best-governed state in Italy was Parma. Ferdinand, Duke of Parma
    and Piacenza, was the only son of Don Philip, the second son of Philip
    <span class="smcap">V.</span> of Spain and Elizabeth Farnese, by Elizabeth of France,
    daughter of Louis <span class="smcap">XV.</span> He was educated by the celebrated French
    philosopher, Condillac, and early in his reign showed the influence of
    the best eighteenth century ideas. He had succeeded his father in 1765,
    and continued his minister, a Frenchman, Du Tillot, Marquis of Felino,
    in office. Du Tillot, though working in a smaller sphere, was as great
    a reformer as Pombal and Tanucci. He brought about the suppression of
    the Inquisition in Parma, improved the internal administration, and
    encouraged education so greatly that the University of Parma, under
    the management of the learned scholar, Paciaudi, became one of the
    most famous in Europe. In 1769 Duke Ferdinand married Maria Amelia,
    daughter of the Empress Maria Theresa, who two years later secured the
    dismissal of Du Tillot from office. This dismissal was not, however,
    followed by a reaction, though it put a close to the progress of
    reform, and Parma, under the administration, first of a Spaniard,
    Llanos, and then of a Frenchman, Mauprat, retained its reputation as
    a well governed state. It was otherwise with Modena, where the last
    Duke of the House of Este, Hercules <span class="smcap">III.</span>, reigned. This
    prince had succeeded to the duchies of Modena, Reggio, and Mirandola
    in 1780, when already a man of fifty-three, and had added to them by
    marriage the principalities of Massa and Carrara. His only daughter
    and heiress, Maria Beatrice, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span> married to the Austrian Archduke
    Ferdinand, younger brother of the Emperor Joseph, and Governor-General
    of Lombardy. Duke Hercules was a superstitious and avaricious ruler,
    whose chief care was to amass money, and, politically, he followed out
    the wishes of Austria. While the House of Austria, by its scions or by
    marriages, ruled the greater part of Italy indirectly, it possessed the
    direct sovereignty of Lombardy, or, more accurately, of the Milanese
    and Mantua. This province profited by the salutary policy of Joseph
    <span class="smcap">II.</span>, and was administered, under the governor-generalship
    of the Archduke Ferdinand, by a great statesman, Count Firmian, who
    understood and carried out the most important reforms. His patronage
    of the arts and of education was especially remarkable; he laboured
    ardently to restore the efficiency of the Universities of Milan and
    Pavia, and appointed Beccaria, the celebrated philanthropist, Professor
    of Political Economy at the former, and Volta, the equally celebrated
    man of science, Professor of Physics at the latter. The only other
    monarchy of Italy, that of Sardinia, was more closely related to France
    than to Austria. Its king, Victor Amadeus <span class="smcap">III.</span>, had married
    a Spanish princess, and two of his daughters were married to the two
    brothers of Louis <span class="smcap">XVI.</span> of France—Monsieur, the Comte de
    Provence, and the Comte d’Artois. His dominions comprised the island
    of Sardinia, Piedmont, Savoy, and Nice, and it was a great subject
    of complaint to his Piedmontese subjects that he unduly favoured his
    French-speaking province of Savoy. He, too, was influenced by the
    spirit of his century; he encouraged agriculture and commerce; he
    patronised literature and science; he built the Observatory at Turin,
    and founded academies of science and fine arts; and he undertook great
    public works, of which the most important was the improvement of the
    harbour of Nice. But in one matter he pursued an opposite policy to the
    Grand Duke Leopold of Tuscany, for he increased and reorganised his
    army, and constructed fortifications of the most modern description
    at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span> Tortona and Alessandria. Lastly must be noticed three Italian
    republics, survivals of the Middle Ages. Of these the smallest was the
    Republic of Lucca, which was entirely surrounded by the Grand Duchy of
    Tuscany. Its trade suffered from the encouragement given by the Grand
    Duke Leopold to Leghorn; but, on the whole, it was well governed and
    prosperous. It was otherwise with the two great aristocratic republics,
    in which the long continuance of oligarchical government had stamped
    out all vestiges of political liberty. The Republic of Genoa, of which
    Raphael di Ferrari was Doge in 1789, was in utter decay. Its people
    were poverty-stricken; its trade had gone to Leghorn and Nice; and
    its laws and customs were unreformed. It was so weak that it had been
    unable to subdue the rebels in Corsica, who had risen under Paoli for
    the right of self-government, and it had ended by ceding the island
    to France in 1768. The Republic of Venice, of which the Doge in 1789
    was Paul Renier, had not fallen so low in the eyes of Europe. Its
    possessions on the mainland, which extended from Verona to the Tyrol
    and along the east coast of the Adriatic Sea, and included the Ionian
    Islands, were administered for the benefit of the Venetian oligarchy,
    and supplied it with wealth. From Dalmatia was raised a considerable
    army, but the administration was wholly selfish, and did not keep pace
    in enlightenment with that of Lombardy, Parma, Tuscany, and Naples. On
    the whole, where monarchy existed in Italy, it tended in the eighteenth
    century to benevolent despotism; and such rule was far more beneficial
    to the people than that of the antiquated republics. Politically, the
    whole country might be reckoned as a factor in the Franco-Austrian
    alliance.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">England: George III.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">The Policy of Pitt.</div>

  <p>The chief power of the Triple Alliance, which balanced the
    loosely-defined league of Russia, France, and Austria, was England.
    The severe blow which had been struck by the revolt of her American
    colonies had made Great Britain appear weaker than she really was to
    the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span> powers of the Continent. The Treaty of Versailles, by which she
    had been obliged to make cessions to France, seemed to have set the
    seal on her humiliation. But in reality her finances were more affected
    than her fighting strength, and the English navy, which, from her
    insular position, must always constitute the principal element of her
    force, was as excellent as ever. The policy of the younger Pitt, who
    had come into office in 1783, was one of peace and retrenchment. The
    country had lasted well through the financial strain of the American
    War, and the chief aim of the minister was to allow its vast commercial
    and industrial resources to expand. As a pupil of Adam Smith, Pitt
    understood the great principles of political economy, and the most
    significant part of his foreign policy was his conclusion of the
    Commercial Treaty with France. A fiscal system, far in advance of that
    in any continental country, enabled the English Government to draw on
    the wealth of the nation more effectively than any other government,
    if the money was needed for patriotic purposes. In spite of his love
    of peace, Pitt was induced by his first Foreign Secretary, the Duke of
    Leeds, to take an active part in European politics, and was eventually
    led by the state of affairs in Holland to enter into the Triple
    Alliance. At home, England was unaffected by the intellectual movement
    which led to the French Revolution. She had in the previous century
    got rid of the relics of feudalism, which pressed so heavily on the
    continental farmer and peasant, and had won the boons of individual and
    commercial liberty, and of equality before the law; while politically,
    though her government was an oligarchy, supported by the class of
    wealthy merchants and traders, an opportunity was afforded through
    the existence of a free press and of the system of election, however
    hampered by antiquated franchises, for public opinion to make itself
    felt.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Prussia: Frederick William II.</div>

  <p>Prussia, the other principal member of the Triple Alliance, contrasted
    in every way with England. Seemingly, owing to the prestige of
    Frederick the Great’s victories and that able<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span> monarch’s careful
    organisation of his army, Prussia was the first military state in
    Europe; in reality, her reputation was greater than her actual power.
    Prussia was weak where England was strong. Prussia had no financial
    system worthy of the name, no industrial wealth, and no national bank;
    her only resources for war were a certain quantity of specie stored
    up in Berlin. The Prussian Government was an absolutism, in which the
    monarch’s will was supreme; its administration was based on feudalism,
    of which England had entirely and France had practically got rid, with
    all its mediæval incidents of serfdom, privilege of the nobility, and
    social and commercial inequalities. The Prussian army was not national;
    the soldiers were treated as slaves, and the officers, who were all of
    noble birth, were tyrants in the maintenance of military discipline.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Policy of Prussia.</div>

  <p>Frederick the Great was one of the finest types of the benevolent
    despot of the eighteenth century, but in him the belief in the
    importance of his despotic power outweighed his benevolence. While
    wishing for the prosperity of the people, he deliberately maintained
    the authority of the nobility, and discouraged any desire for change
    on the part of the agriculturists or citizens. The former were left
    at the disposal of their lords, the latter trammelled by antiquated
    civic constitutions. The weakness of Prussia was not only inherent in
    its government, but was also due to geographical causes. Its component
    parts were scattered; its Rhenish duchies and East Friesland were
    separated from its main territories by many German states; its central
    districts, the Marks of Brandenburg, were sparsely populated, and cut
    off from the sea; its largest provinces, Prussia Proper, Pomerania,
    Silesia, and Prussian Poland were, in spite of German and French
    Huguenot colonies, mainly Slavonic, and as backward in civilisation as
    other Slavonic races in the eighteenth century. In Russia, however,
    the Slavonic population in its barbarism yet retained sufficient local
    organisation to make its lot fairly endurable; in eastern Prussia,
    and especially in Prussian Poland, the people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span> had been brought
    into contact with the mediæval and Latin civilisation, and were
    consequently treated as absolute serfs without the relief afforded by
    local institutions. The policy of Prussia, as laid down by Frederick
    the Great, had both Prussian and German aspirations, and in both was
    utterly selfish. The example set by the cynical monarch in the Silesian
    wars had left a deep impress on the minds of Prussian statesmen, and
    the maxims of justice and international law were subordinated by them
    to expediency. The Prussian policy of Frederick the Great culminated
    in the first partition of Poland, which he had suggested, by means
    of which Prussia united her eastern province of Prussia Proper to
    Brandenburg, and cut off Poland from the sea, and the aim of his
    successors was to pursue this path of aggrandisement, and, by further
    annexations, to connect Silesia directly with Prussia Proper. The
    German policy of Prussia was to assume the leadership of the Empire
    by pretending the greatest zeal for the rights of the Princes of the
    Empire, and posing as their protector, and it was on this ground that
    Frederick the Great formed the League of the Princes. The hereditary
    enemy of Prussia was Austria, which, though distinctly injured by
    the conquest of Silesia, still retained the chief influence over the
    Empire, and also showed a tendency to check the designs on Poland.
    It was Frederick the Great of Prussia who had thwarted the Emperor’s
    scheme of exchanging the Austrian Netherlands for Bavaria, and he
    intrigued against Austria at the Courts both of Russia and France. It
    was as a counterblow to the Franco-Austro-Russian alliance that Prussia
    intervened in Holland, at the request of England, and formed the Triple
    Alliance with England and Holland in 1788. King Frederick William
    <span class="smcap">II.</span> of Prussia, who succeeded his famous uncle in 1786, was
    a man of feeble intellect and undecided nature, but he had thoroughly
    imbibed the classic ideas of Prussian policy, and regarded Austria
    as the inevitable foe of Prussia, to be duped and taken advantage of
    on every possible occasion. His chief minister, Hertzberg, was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
    consistent enemy of Austria, but owing to the curious character of the
    king, the real power of the State rested not with the minister but
    with the royal favourites, of whom the chief at the end of 1788 were
    Bischofswerder and Lucchesini.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Holland.</div>

  <p>Holland was the link which bound England and Prussia together. Its
    military power was of no account, but the wealth of its inhabitants,
    derived from their vast commercial expansion in Asia and aptitude
    for banking, made the Republic of the United Provinces of the
    greatest importance. The Seven Provinces preserved the most complete
    autonomy; only the veriest semblance of federation held them
    together. Practically, the only bond of union was in the power of the
    Stadtholder, which had been restored in 1747. In the more wealthy
    provinces, such as Holland, the commercial aristocracy, which filled
    the ranks of the local governments, resented the position of the
    Stadtholder, who held the command-in-chief of the army and navy; but in
    the poorer and agricultural provinces, such as Friesland and Groningen,
    the landed aristocracy generally supported the Stadtholderate. In 1780
    the United Provinces had joined in the Neutral League of the North,
    invented by Catherine of Russia to break the commercial supremacy of
    England, and in the war which followed they had suffered severe losses,
    and had been compelled to cede Negapatam in India to England in 1783 on
    the conclusion of peace. The Stadtholder, William <span class="smcap">V.</span>, Prince
    of Orange, in whose family the office had been declared hereditary, was
    vehemently accused of favouring England during this war, and when peace
    was declared a movement was set on foot, headed by the authorities of
    the Province of Holland, to oust him from his position, and to draw
    up a new constitution for the Dutch Netherlands on the same lines
    as that of the United States of America. This movement grew to its
    height in 1786; a French Legion, commanded by the Comte de Maillebois,
    was raised; the Stadtholder had to fly from the Hague, and the armed
    intervention of France was requested. But, as has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span> been said, France,
    in spite of her seeming power, was too weak to intervene, and the
    Dutch patriots were abandoned to their fate. On the other side, that
    of the Stadtholder, England, through its able ambassador at the Hague,
    Sir James Harris, afterwards Lord Malmesbury, induced Prussia to
    act. England and Prussia had dynastic and political reasons for this
    conduct. The Stadtholder was, through his mother, a first cousin of
    George <span class="smcap">III.</span>, and had married a sister of Frederick William
    <span class="smcap">II.</span>, while politically, the acquisition of Holland to the
    Franco-Austrian alliance, through the expulsion of the Stadtholder,
    would bring nearly the whole of Europe into that system, and would
    practically enclose the Austrian Netherlands or Belgium. In September
    1787, therefore, a Prussian army, under the Duke of Brunswick, had
    occupied Amsterdam, and placed the Stadtholder firmly in power; the
    Dutch patriots fled to France; the Legion of Maillebois was disbanded;
    and in 1788 the work was consummated by the signature of the Triple
    Alliance.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Denmark: Christian VII.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Sweden: Gustavus III.</div>

  <p>The two northern kingdoms, Denmark and Sweden, had adhered to the
    Neutral League against England in 1780, but for generations a bitter
    animosity had existed between them. Denmark, which in 1789 included
    Norway, was in an extremely prosperous condition. The philanthropic
    ideas of the eighteenth century had made great way, and on 20th
    June 1788 a royal ordinance had destroyed the last vestige of
    serfdom. Efforts were made to improve the condition of the people by
    reorganising the state of the finances, law and education, and progress
    was made in every direction. These reforms were not the work of the
    King, Christian <span class="smcap">VII.</span>, who had fallen into a state of dotage,
    but of the Prince Royal, afterwards Frederick <span class="smcap">VI.</span>, and of his
    minister, Count Andrew Bernstorff, the nephew of the greatest Danish
    statesman of the eighteenth century. Sweden, which in 1789 included the
    greater part of Finland as well as Swedish Pomerania and the island
    of Rügen, was under the sway of one of the most enlightened rulers of
    the century,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span> Gustavus <span class="smcap">III.</span> That monarch had in 1772, by a
    <i>coup d’état</i>, overthrown the power of the Swedish Estates, with their
    division into the two parties of the Caps and the Hats, subsidised
    respectively by Russia and France. He had made use of his absolutism to
    carry out some of the benevolent ideas of the time. He had abolished
    torture, regulated taxation, encouraged commerce and industry, and
    diminished, where he did not destroy, the privileges of the nobility.
    Had he contented himself with these internal reforms he would have
    won the lasting gratitude of the Swedish people, but he insisted on
    playing a part in continental politics, which involved the maintenance
    of a large army and the consequent exhaustion of the people. Though he
    too had joined the League of the North in 1780, he afterwards assumed
    a strong anti-Russian attitude, and resolved to take advantage of
    the Russo-Turkish war in order to regain some of his lost provinces.
    Accordingly he invaded Russia in the summer of 1788, while his fleet
    threatened St. Petersburg.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Empire.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">The Diet.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">College of Electors.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">College of Princes.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">College of Free Cities.</div>

  <p>Hitherto a sketch has been given of states, which in 1789 possessed a
    certain unity, and were able to play a part as independent countries
    of more or less weight in European politics. It was otherwise with
    the Holy Roman Empire, which still remained in the same condition,
    and was ruled in the same manner, as had been arranged at the Treaty
    of Westphalia in 1648. True Germany, that is Germany to the west of
    the Oder, had been under this arrangement split up into a number of
    independent sovereignties, loosely bound together as the Holy Roman
    Empire. The number of these petty states caused the Empire to be, from
    a military point of view, utterly inefficient; the bond was too loose
    to allow of general internal reforms or of a consistent foreign policy;
    and the federal arrangements were too cumbrous and unwieldy to allow
    of Germany ranking as a great power. The Imperial Diet or Reichstag
    consisted of three colleges, and a majority was required in each of
    the upper colleges to agree to a resolution, which, when confirmed by
    the Emperor, became a <i>conclusum</i> of the Empire.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span> The first of these
    colleges was that of the eight Electors, three ecclesiastical, the
    Elector-Archbishops of Mayence, Trèves, and Cologne, and five lay, the
    Electors of Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Hanover, who were also Kings of
    Hungary, Prussia, and England, the Elector of Saxony, and the Elector
    Palatine, who in 1789 was also Elector of Bavaria. The president of
    this college was the Elector-Archbishop of Mayence, as Chancellor of
    the Empire. The second college was that of the Princes, which consisted
    of one hundred voices, thirty-six ecclesiastical and sixty-four
    lay. In this college all the Electors had voices under different
    designations; Hanover possessed six for different principalities,
    Prussia six for the duchy of Guelders, the county of Mœurs, etc.,
    Austria three, and so on, while the Kings of Denmark and Sweden also
    were represented as Dukes of Holstein and of Pomerania. Less important
    princes differing in power from the Landgraves of Hesse, the Margraves
    of Baden, and the Duke of Würtemburg to the petty princes of Salm and
    Anhalt, possessed single voices, and made up the number of temporal
    voters in the college to sixty. The ecclesiastical princes included
    thirty-four of the wealthiest bishops and abbots, many of whom ruled
    over considerable territories, and of whom the most important were the
    Archbishop of Salzburg, the Bishops of Bamberg, Augsburg, Würtzburg,
    Spires, Worms, Strasbourg, Basle, Constance, Paderborn, Hildesheim,
    and Münster, and the Abbots of Elwangen, Kempten, and Stablo. The
    other six voices were called collegiate, and representatives to hold
    them were elected by the petty lay and ecclesiastical sovereigns
    who abounded in Franconia, Swabia, and Westphalia, to the number of
    four lay and two ecclesiastical representatives. The presidency of
    this college was held alternately by the Archduke of Austria and the
    Archbishop of Salzburg. The third or inferior college was that of the
    free cities, and any opposition on its part could prevent a decision
    arrived at by the two upper or superior colleges being presented
    to the Emperor for his assent as a <i>conclusum</i> of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span> Empire. It
    consisted of the representatives of fifty-two imperial free cities,
    divided into two ‘benches,’ of which the Bench of Westphalia included
    Frankfort-on-the-Main, Cologne, Aix-la-Chapelle, Hamburg, Bremen, and
    Lübeck, and the Bench of Swabia included Nuremberg, Ratisbon, Ulm,
    and Augsburg. The presidency of this college belonged to the city
    of Ratisbon, in which the Diet held its sittings. By this elaborate
    federative system, all sense of German unity was lost; the electors,
    princes, and free cities were represented only by delegates; the
    smaller states felt themselves swamped and were obliged to look to a
    great power, Austria or France, Prussia or Hanover, to preserve their
    political independence.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Emperor.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">The Aulic Council.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">The Circles.</div>

  <p>The other important institution of the Empire, the Imperial Tribunal
    or Reichskammergericht, which sat at Wetzlar and was intended to
    settle disputes between the German sovereigns, had also fallen into
    desuetude. Its venality and procrastination became proverbial, and it
    possessed no machinery to put its decrees into force. At the head of
    the Empire was the Emperor, who was elected and crowned with all the
    elaborate ceremonial of the Middle Ages. The office had been, with
    one exception, conferred on the head of House of Austria, since the
    Treaty of Westphalia, but it brought little actual authority on the
    holder. It was as ruler of the hereditary dominions of the House of
    Hapsburg that the Emperor exerted some influence, not as an Emperor.
    Joseph <span class="smcap">II.</span>, indeed, endeavoured to be Emperor in more than
    name, with the result that Frederick the Great was enabled to form
    the League of Princes against him. As the chief Catholic state,
    Austria, however, possessed a great influence in the Imperial Diet,
    for the ecclesiastical members of the Colleges of Electors and Princes
    naturally inclined to support her, and it was on their votes that
    she relied. She even went so far as to establish the Aulic Council
    at Vienna, which intervened in cases between sovereign princes, and
    usurped some of the prerogatives of the Imperial Tribunal of Wetzlar.
    The executive power of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span> Empire, when it had come to a decision, was
    entrusted to the circles. These circles each had their own Diet, and it
    was their duty, for instance, to raise money and troops when the Empire
    decided to go to war. Of the ten circles of the Empire, originally
    created, one, that of Burgundy, had been extinguished or nearly so by
    the conquests of Louis <span class="smcap">XIV.</span>, and those situated in the eastern
    portion were entirely controlled by the important states of Prussia,
    Saxony, and Austria. It was only in Western Germany, in the circles
    of Westphalia, Franconia, and Swabia that the organisation was fairly
    tried, and the result was signal failure, whenever those circles put
    their contingents in the field. It could hardly be otherwise, when,
    owing to minute subdivision and divided authority, a single company of
    soldiers might be raised from half a dozen different petty sovereigns,
    each of whom would try to throw the burden of their maintenance on
    his colleagues. The Holy Roman Empire, in short, like other mediæval
    institutions, had fallen into decay with the mediæval systems of
    warfare and religion; some of its component states, such as Austria
    and Prussia, or in a lesser degree Bavaria, might possess a real
    power; but, as a whole, it was utterly inefficient to defend itself,
    and formed a feeble barrier between France and the kingdoms of Eastern
    Europe.</p>

  <p>The impotence of the Empire for offensive and defensive purposes did
    not, however, greatly affect the German people; the educated classes
    prided themselves on being superior to patriotic impulses, and on being
    cosmopolitan rather than German; the poorer classes thought more of
    the internal administration which affected them than of the attitude
    of the Empire to European politics. The tendency towards benevolent
    despotism, which distinguished the greater powers, showed itself also
    in the petty states of Germany in the diminution, if not the abolition,
    of the ancient Estates and in the restraints placed on the authority
    of the nobility. The increased power of the sovereign was generally,
    if not universally, used to foster the prosperity of his subjects,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
    or at least to promote literature and art. A notice of a few of the
    principal rulers of Germany will justify this view. Charles Theodore,
    the Elector Palatine, who in 1778 had succeeded to the Electorate
    of Bavaria, and united once more the territories of the House of
    Wittelsbach, was a most enlightened sovereign. In the Palatinate he had
    founded a brilliant University at Mannheim, and one of the most famous
    picture galleries in Europe at Düsseldorf; in Bavaria he suppressed
    some of the numerous convents, which stifled progress, in spite of his
    sincere Catholicism. He took as one of his ministers the celebrated
    American, Benjamin Thompson, whom he created Count Rumford, and that
    man of science and learning endeavoured to suppress mendacity, and made
    efforts to bring material comforts within reach of the very poorest.
    Nevertheless, in some points, the Elector Charles Theodore showed
    himself a bigot; he left education entirely in the hands of the Roman
    Catholic priesthood and ex-Jesuits, and he allowed the Protestants in
    his dominions to be persecuted. The Margrave Charles Frederick, who
    in 1771 reunited in his person the two margraviates of Baden-Baden
    and Baden-Durlach, was a more thoroughly enlightened prince. He was
    truly a benevolent despot; he was a student of political economy, on
    which he himself wrote a treatise, and applied its principles to his
    little state; he established a scheme of primary education; and on 23d
    July 1783 he abolished serfdom in his dominions, while maintaining
    the royal <i>corvées</i> and the prohibition for a subject to leave the
    country without obtaining his permission. The Duke Charles Eugène of
    Würtemburg formed a contrast to his neighbours. He established, like
    them, his own absolutism, but he used his power to impose heavy taxes
    and raise an army out of all proportion to the size of his duchy.
    He treated his subjects like slaves, and his administration was so
    cruel that the Aulic Council threatened to take measures against him.
    Nevertheless, he was a patron of literature and the arts. He built a
    theatre at Stuttgart and founded the Academy of Fine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span> Arts there, and
    he defrayed the expense of the education of the poet Schiller, who,
    however, afterwards satirised him and fled to Weimar. Yet Charles
    Eugène of Würtemburg appears an enlightened monarch to such princes as
    Duke Charles of Deux-Ponts (Zweibrücken), whose successor, Maximilian
    Joseph, was to succeed the Elector Palatine, Charles Theodore, and
    to become the first King of Bavaria, for that prince sacrificed his
    people to his passion for the chase, and to William <span class="smcap">IX.</span>,
    Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel, who sold his subjects by the hundred to
    the English Government to carry on the war in America. Going further
    east, Saxony, which had ranked among the great states of Germany, was
    in a state of decline. The Electors Augustus <span class="smcap">II.</span> and Augustus
    <span class="smcap">III.</span> had been Kings of Poland, and had ruined their hereditary
    dominions to support their royal dignity and position. Fortunately
    Frederick Augustus, who was Elector in 1789, had not been elected to
    the Polish throne, and had been able to do something for the prosperity
    of his subjects. He formed a commission to draw up a code of laws, he
    abolished torture, encouraged industry and agriculture, and founded
    an Academy of Mines. But he did not go so far, for instance, as the
    Margrave of Baden, and made no attempt to suppress serfdom. The glory
    of Saxony was not, however, on the eve of the French Revolution its
    electoral house; its intellectual capital was not the beautiful city of
    Dresden. That place was taken by Weimar, where Duke Charles Augustus
    of Saxe-Weimar collected around him the great philosophers and men of
    letters who made the German name famous at the end of the eighteenth
    century and the beginning of the nineteenth. To his Court resorted the
    most illustrious Germans of the time, Goethe and Schiller, Herder,
    Wieland, and Musæus; and the University of his state at Jena became the
    most famous in Germany. It is not necessary to particularise the other
    states; it is enough to say that those in the north were generally
    very backward, especially the duchies of Mecklenburg, and that Hanover
    was left to the rule of an aristocratic oligarchy, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span> allowed
    no reforms, although its University at Göttingen, founded by George
    <span class="smcap">II.</span>, took rank with the best.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Mayence.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Trèves.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Cologne.</div>

  <p>The Ecclesiastical States followed also the movement of the century.
    The ecclesiastical rulers were often enlightened men, but they were
    to a great extent the slaves of their chapters. These chapters were
    generally filled by younger sons of the smaller princes, who insisted
    on the newly-elected prelates entering into the closest bonds with
    them to make no changes in the feudal system in the bishoprics. The
    prince-bishops and abbots at the close of the eighteenth century were,
    therefore, generally scions of noble houses, such as, for instance,
    Francis Joseph, Baron of Roggenbach, Bishop of Basle, Baron Francis
    Louis of Erthal, Bishop of Bamberg and Würtzburg, the Baron of Rödt,
    Bishop of Constance, the Count of Hoensbroeck, Bishop of Liége,
    Count Augustus of Limburg, Bishop of Spires, Count Jerome Colloredo,
    Archbishop of Salzburg, and the Baron of Plettenberg, Abbot of Münster.
    One curious point deserves notice, that in some instances, Protestant
    princes had the right to present to Catholic prince-bishoprics, and
    in 1789 the Duke of York was Prince-Bishop of Osnabrück, and Prince
    Peter Frederick of Holstein-Gottorp, Prince-Bishop of Lübeck. Of
    higher rank and more independent of their chapters were the three
    archbishop-electors, who were therefore more able to rule their states
    in consonance with the ideas of the century. The chief of these was
    Baron Frederick Charles of Erthal, Archbishop-Elector of Mayence, and
    Prince-Bishop of Worms, the Chancellor of the Empire <i>ex officio</i>. This
    great prelate busied himself mostly with his pleasures, but his rank
    caused his countenance to be sought by all parties, and his adhesion
    to Frederick the Great’s League of Princes was the greatest gain the
    King of Prussia made in his anti-Austrian policy. In 1789 he had
    completely abandoned the cares of internal and external politics to his
    coadjutor Charles, Baron de Dalberg, who was to play a leading part
    in the history of Germany during the period of the French Revolution
    and Napoleon. The Archbishop-Elector <span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>of Trèves in 1789 was Clement
    Wenceslas, a Saxon prince, and an excellent ruler, who, in 1783,
    even issued an edict of tolerance, allowing men of any religion to
    settle in his state, and exercise any trade or profession there. The
    last Elector-Archbishop was the Archduke Maximilian, the youngest
    brother of the Emperor Joseph, Archbishop of Cologne, who shared his
    brother’s liberal opinions, and patronised his predecessor’s creation,
    the University of Bonn, which had been founded in opposition to the
    ultramontane University of Cologne, for the encouragement of the modern
    developments of science. The tendency of all these governments, lay
    and clerical, was to promote the prosperity of the people; Joseph
    <span class="smcap">II.</span> was but the type of the German princes of his time; all
    wished to do good for the people, but not by them; their characters
    differed widely, from the enlightened Margrave of Baden to the hunting
    Duke of Deux-Ponts; but in their different ways and in different
    degrees they generally meant well. But, while the more important
    princes showed the tendency of the century, their poorer contemporaries
    were unable to do so. They were mostly in debt, owing to their efforts
    to rival the wealthy princes, and in order to raise money resorted to
    all the devices of mediæval feudalism. The few villages over which they
    ruled suffered from this tyranny, and it was always possible to know
    when a traveller crossed the frontier into one of these ‘duodecimo
    duchies.’ Beneath the petty princes were the Ritters or Knights of the
    Empire, who abounded in Franconia and Swabia. These knights had no
    representation in the Imperial Diet, and were consequently dependent
    directly on the Emperor. Their poverty made them take service with
    the wealthy princes; and to quote but two instances, Stein, the great
    Prussian minister, and Würmser, the celebrated Austrian general, were
    both Knights of the Empire. The result of this minute subdivision of
    Germany was to destroy the sense of national patriotism; which was
    not to rise again until after Germany had passed through the mould of
    Napoleon’s domination.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span></p>

  <div class="sidenote">Switzerland.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Geneva.</div>

  <p>The other European confederation, Switzerland, presented the same
    symptoms of internal decay as the Holy Roman Empire, but it was
    preserved from the same political degradation by the consciousness
    of its nationality and the persistence of its local governments. The
    eighteenth century was marked in Switzerland by struggles between
    canton and canton, Catholics and Protestants, nobles and bourgeois.
    In some cantons, such as Berne, an oligarchical system was maintained
    in the hands of a few noble families; in others, such as Uri, a
    purely democratic form of government was preserved, which allowed
    every peasant a voice in the local administration. Where feudalism
    had been established, the peasants were in no better condition than
    in the rest of Europe, but in the mountain cantons such a <i>régime</i>
    was impossible, and individual and political freedom still existed.
    It must be remembered that the Switzerland of the eighteenth century
    was not identical with that of the nineteenth. The Grisons formed no
    part of the confederation, Neufchâtel belonged to Prussia, and Geneva
    was an independent republic. The part the latter had played in the
    intellectual movement of the century was most conspicuous. Rousseau
    was born in Geneva, and Voltaire retired and spent his last years in
    its neighbourhood. But Geneva had just before 1789 been the scene of a
    revolution resembling that in Holland. A struggle broke out between the
    bourgeois families, which monopolised the magistracy, and the mass of
    the people, which had ended in the victory of the former. The Genevese
    democrats were expelled, and many of them, notably Clavière, exercised
    a considerable influence on the course of the Revolution in France.</p>

  <p>The state of Europe in 1789 showed everywhere a sense of awakening
    to new ideas. The bonds of feudalism were ready to break asunder;
    the benevolent despots had recognised the rights of individual and
    commercial freedom; the French Revolution was able to sow in ripe
    ground the two new principles of the sovereignty of the people and the
    sentiment of nationality.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Catherine and Joseph II. 1789.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">At</span> the commencement of the year 1789 the thoughts of European statesmen
    were mainly turned to the events which were passing in the east of
    Europe. The alliance between Catherine of Russia and the Emperor Joseph
    <span class="smcap">II.</span> was regarded with anxiety not only by Pitt in England
    and by King Frederick William <span class="smcap">II.</span> of Prussia, but by the
    French ministers and by all the smaller states of Europe. The projects
    of Russia and Austria for the extension of their boundaries at the
    expense of Turkey, Poland, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span> Bavaria, were viewed with alarm, and
    the ambitious ideas of their rulers with dismay. The attention of
    educated people, who were not statesmen or politicians, but disciples
    of the philosophical teachers of the eighteenth century, was entirely
    concentrated on the progress of the Emperor Joseph’s policy in the
    Austrian Netherlands or Belgium. Success seemed to have crowned the
    warlike measures of General d’Alton; the Belgian patriots were in
    prison or in exile; and the philanthropic and centralising reforms of
    the Emperor seemed to have ended in Belgium in the establishment of
    a military despotism. France was known to be in an almost desperate
    financial condition; and the convocation of the States-General for
    1st May 1789, was generally looked upon as a means adopted by Louis
    <span class="smcap">XVI.</span> to obtain financial relief. The great results, which
    were to follow the meeting of the States-General, were little expected
    by even the most acute political observers, and it was not foreseen
    that for more than a quarter of a century the interest of Europe was
    to be fixed upon France, and that a series of events in that country,
    unparalleled in history, were to bring about an entire modification in
    the political system of Europe, and to open a new era in the history of
    mankind.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The War with the Turks.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Joseph’s prediction.</div>

  <p>The campaign of 1788 had, upon the whole, terminated favourably for
    the Austrians and Russians in their war with the Turks. Loudon, who
    commanded the Austrian forces, had taken Dubitza, and penetrating into
    Bosnia had reduced Novi on 3d October. Francis Josias, of the House of
    Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, commonly known as the Prince of Coburg, at the
    head of an Austrian army, had in conjunction with a Russian force under
    Prince Soltikov taken Choczim on 20th September. But, on the other
    hand, the Turks had overrun and laid waste the Banat of Temesvar and
    routed the Austrian army in that quarter, which was under the personal
    command of the Emperor. The Russians had also made some progress, and
    on 6th December Potemkin, with terrible loss of life, and owing mainly
    to the intrepidity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span> of Suvórov and Repnin stormed Oczakoff (Ochakov).
    These successes, despite his own failure, greatly inspirited Joseph,
    who, in a letter to Prince Charles of Nassau, made the following
    curious predictions in January 1789:<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>—‘If the Grand Vizier should
    come to meet me or the Russians near the Danube, he must offer a
    battle; and then, after having defeated him, I shall drive him back
    to take refuge under the cannon of Silistria. In October 1789 I shall
    call a congress, at which the Osmanlis will be obliged to beg for peace
    from the Giaours. The treaties of Carlowitz and Passarowitz will serve
    as the basis for my ambassadors on which to conclude peace; in it,
    however, I shall claim Choczim and part of Moldavia. Russia will keep
    the Crimea, Prince Charles of Sweden will be Duke of Courland, and the
    Grand Duke of Florence King of the Romans. Then there will be universal
    peace in Europe. Until then, France will have settled affairs with the
    notables of the nation; and the other gentlemen think too much about
    themselves and too little about Austria.’</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Campaign of 1789.</div>

  <p>The campaign of 1789 was far from fulfilling the expectations of
    the Emperor Joseph. His own health had suffered too much from the
    privations of the previous year to enable him to take the field again
    in person, but he was well served by his generals. The Grand Vizier
    determined to adopt the offensive, and crossed the Danube at Rustchuk
    in March at the head of an army of 90,000 men, with the intention of
    invading Transylvania. But an unexpected event led to the recall of
    the most experienced Turkish general. The Sultan Abdul Hamid died
    at Constantinople on 7th April, and his nephew and successor, Selim
    <span class="smcap">III.</span>, at once disgraced the Grand Vizier, and replaced him in
    the command of the western army and the office of Grand Vizier by the
    Pasha of Widdin. This incompetent commander rashly advanced, and was
    defeated by the Prince of Coburg and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>Suvoróv at Foksany on 31st July
    in an attempt to prevent the junction of the Austrians and Russians.
    The allies then took the offensive and inflicted a crushing defeat on
    the main Turkish army on the Rymnik, in which 18,000 Austrians and
    7000 Russians routed nearly 100,000 Turks, and took all their baggage
    and artillery. This great victory was vigorously followed up. Loudon
    was appointed Commander-in-chief of the Austrian army, and he took
    Belgrade on 9th October, and after occupying the whole of Servia, laid
    siege to Orsova. For these services Joseph conferred upon him the title
    of generalissimo, which had only been borne before by Wallenstein,
    Montecuculi, and Prince Eugène. Among other results of the victory on
    the Rymnik, the Prince of Coburg took Bucharest and occupied Moldavia,
    while the Prince of Hohenlohe-Kirchberg forced his way into Wallachia.
    In the eastern quarter of the Turkish frontier Prince Potemkin was
    equally successful. He defeated the Turkish High Admiral, Hassan Pasha,
    in a pitched battle at Tobac, and conquered Bessarabia, capturing
    Bender, and laying siege to Ismail.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Revolution in Sweden.</div>

  <p>Doubtless Catherine and Joseph would have met with even greater
    successes, and perhaps they might have driven the Turks out of Europe,
    had not their attention been diverted directly by the affairs of Sweden
    and Belgium, and indirectly by the startling events which were taking
    place in France. The Triple Alliance looked with great disfavour on the
    alliance between Austria and Russia. Pitt, as has been said, prepared
    a great fleet, which is known in English naval history as the Russian
    Armament, and Frederick William <span class="smcap">II.</span> began to negotiate an
    alliance with Turkey. But they limited their direct interference to
    inducing Denmark to make peace with Sweden. Gustavus <span class="smcap">III.</span> of
    Sweden had, in 1788, forced his way at the head of 30,000 men into
    Russian Finland, and the sound of his guns had been heard in Saint
    Petersburg, which, owing to the absence of the bulk of the Russian
    troops, was almost defenceless. But the Swedish nobility had great
    influence over the army; they disliked the war with Russia;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span> and took
    this opportunity to declare themselves. Under the secret leadership
    of Prince Charles, Duke of Sudermania, they refused to obey the
    king’s orders, and hoped in the embarrassment which ensued to regain
    their former power. At this moment Christian <span class="smcap">VII.</span>, King of
    Denmark and Norway, at the instance of Catherine, invaded Sweden and
    prepared to besiege Gothenburg. Gustavus saw the opportunity which
    this invasion offered to rouse the patriotic feelings of the Swedes.
    He appealed to the people, and leaving the command of the army in
    Finland to the Duke of Sudermania, raised a fresh army of volunteers
    to resist the invaders. In spite of his efforts, Sweden was in great
    danger of falling before the combined attacks of Russia and Denmark.
    The Triple Alliance now intervened promptly and decisively, and by
    threatening to attack Denmark by land and sea, they induced Bernstorff,
    the Danish minister, to evacuate Sweden and to agree to an armistice.
    Gustavus <span class="smcap">III.</span> returned to Stockholm with the reputation of
    having repulsed the invaders, and summoned the Diet to meet on 2d
    February 1789. Sure of the support of the Commons he proposed a new
    Constitution, or rather a new fundamental law for the Swedish monarchy,
    which is summed up in one of the articles: ‘The king can administer
    the affairs of the State as seems good to him.’ The nobility opposed a
    fruitless resistance; Gustavus imprisoned their leaders and completed
    the work of his former revolution of 1772 by this <i>coup d’état</i>. He
    then renewed the war with Russia, but the military operations of his
    campaign in 1789 were not marked by any event of importance.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Affairs in Belgium, 1789.</div>

  <p>While Catherine of Russia was being distracted from the vigorous
    prosecution of the war against Turkey by the invasion of the Swedes,
    her ally, the Emperor Joseph, was chiefly concerned with the state
    of affairs in the Austrian Netherlands or Belgium. It seemed at
    first as if he was to be as successful as Gustavus in changing the
    old constitution of the country. But there was this difference.
    Whereas Gustavus <span class="smcap">III.</span> was enacting the part of a national<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
    deliverer, and had the Swedish people on his side in his overthrow of
    the nobility, Joseph <span class="smcap">II.</span> was opposed not only by the Belgian
    nobles, but by the clergy and the people also. The country seemed quiet
    enough under the government of Count Trautmannsdorf and the military
    rule of the Captain-General d’Alton. The suppression of the risings at
    Brussels and Louvain, Malines and Antwerp seemed to have established
    the Austrian sway most firmly, and the leading opponents of the
    Emperor’s policy were in exile. The Estates of the different provinces
    were convoked as usual, and all of them, except those of Hainault and
    Brabant, voted the customary subsidies. The Estates of Hainault were at
    once dissolved by a military force, and their constitution abolished
    on 31st January 1789. By this example the Emperor hoped to overawe the
    wealthy and populous province of Brabant, and when it did not have
    the expected effect, he directed Trautmannsdorf to summon a special
    meeting of the Estates of Brabant, and to require them to increase
    the number of deputies of the Third Estate or Commons, and to grant a
    permanent subsidy. He also maintained his attitude towards the Church,
    and tried to compel Cardinal Frankenberg, the Archbishop of Malines, to
    withdraw his opposition to the new Imperial Seminary at Brussels, or
    to resign his see. The Archbishop stoutly refused to comply, and the
    Estates of Brabant proved equally stubborn. Joseph then decided on a
    sudden blow, and by his orders Count Trautmannsdorf, on 18th June 1789,
    declared the ‘Joyeuse Entrée,’ or Constitution of Brabant abolished.
    The day was the anniversary of the battle of Kolin, in which, at the
    crisis of the Seven Years’ War, the Austrians had defeated Frederick
    the Great. D’Alton thought he made a happy comparison in saying: ‘The
    18th of June is a happy epoch for the House of Austria; for on that
    day the glorious victory of Kolin saved the monarchy, and the Emperor
    became master of the Netherlands.’ But the victory was not to be won
    so easily. The two parties of opposition, the Van der Nootists, or
    partisans of Van<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span> der Noot, the supporter of the ancient constitutional
    rights, and the Vonckists, or followers of Vonck, the advocate of
    popular or democratic ideas, united. The Triple Alliance was as glad
    to hamper Joseph’s activity in the East by encouraging these Belgian
    patriots, as it had been to leave Gustavus free to harass Catherine, by
    stopping the interference of Denmark in the north, and the ministers of
    England, Holland, and Prussia all entered into relations with Van der
    Noot. That partisan, encouraged by hopes of active assistance, formed
    a patriotic committee at Breda, on the Dutch frontier, and raised an
    army of exiles, which was placed under the command of Colonel Van der
    Mersch. Joseph was not to be intimidated. D’Alton put down popular
    riots, which broke out in various towns, notably at Tirlemont, Louvain,
    Namur, and Brussels, with unrelenting severity. A sweeping decree was
    issued on 19th October against the exiles or <i>émigrés</i>, declaring that
    ordinary emigration would be punished by banishment and confiscation
    of property, and that joining an armed force on the frontier for the
    purpose of invasion would be punished by death, and that informers
    against <i>émigrés</i> would receive a reward of 10,000 livres and absolute
    impunity.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> But all the Emperor’s measures and decrees were of no
    effect. The meeting of the States-General in France had been followed
    by the capture of the Bastille and the bringing of the King of France
    from Versailles to Paris by a Parisian mob; and the effects of the
    French Revolution on affairs in Belgium was soon to be perceived.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Revolution in Liège.</div>

  <p>In the bishopric of Liège, which, from its situation, always
    reflected and repeated any political troubles that took place in
    Belgium, the influence of the French Revolution was immediately
    felt. The inhabitants of the bishopric had long resented the rule
    of the prince-bishops, and felt the anomaly of being subject to an
    ecclesiastical sovereign. Many exiles from the democratic party in
    Belgium assembled in the bishopric, and on the news of the capture of
    the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>Bastille, the people of Liége needed little persuasion to renew
    their former insurrection. The revolution was carried out without the
    shedding of blood. On 16th and 17th August 1789 the people of the city
    of Liége rose in rebellion; on the 18th MM. Chestret and Fabry were
    chosen burgomasters by popular acclamation, the garrison was disarmed,
    and the citadel occupied by bourgeois national guards. On the same day
    the Prince-Bishop, Count Cæsar Constantine Francis de Hoensbroeck, was
    brought into the city, and he signed a proclamation acknowledging the
    revolution and abrogating the despotic settlement of 1684. The other
    towns in the bishopric followed the example of the capital, and in each
    of them free municipalities were elected and national guards raised and
    armed. The Prince-Bishop, after accepting the loss of his political
    power, fled to Trèves, and considered himself fortunate to be allowed
    to escape.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Elections to the States-General.</div>

  <p>It is now time to examine the course of the events in France, which led
    to such important developments upon its north-east frontier, and which
    distracted the attention of all the monarchs and ministers of Europe,
    except Catherine of Russia, from the wars in the North and East. It
    was owing to the increasing difficulty of raising money for carrying
    on the administration of the State and paying the interest on the
    national debt, and the consequent necessity for revising the system of
    taxation and reorganising the financial resources of France that Louis
    <span class="smcap">XVI.</span>, on the advice of his minister, Loménie de Brienne, had
    vaguely promised in November 1787 to summon the States-General for July
    1792, and had definitely convoked the ancient assembly of France on 8th
    August 1788 to meet at Versailles on 1st May 1789. But the arrangements
    for the elections were not made by Loménie de Brienne, who retired
    from office in the same month as the States-General was convoked,
    but by his successor Necker, who was recalled to office as an expert
    financier, in view of the fact that the summons of the States-General
    was looked on as a purely financial expedient. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span> procedure to be
    adopted in electing deputies gave rise to much anxious deliberation
    and heated controversy in the public press, and the Notables of 1787
    were again assembled to give their advice. The burning question was
    as to the representation of the Tiers État, Third Estate or Commons.
    The ancient representative assembly of France was known to consist
    of the three orders of the Nobility, the Clergy, and the Tiers État,
    and the disputed question was as to the proportion of the number of
    deputies of the Tiers État to that of the two other orders. This and
    the other electoral questions were finally settled by the Résultat du
    Conseil published on 27th December 1788. It was decreed that the royal
    bailliages and royal sénéchaussées, feudal circumscriptions which had
    long fallen into disuse, should be treated as electoral units, and that
    they should elect, according to the extent of their population, one or
    more deputations, each consisting of four members, one chosen by the
    Nobility, one by the Clergy, and two by the Tiers État. The elections
    were to be made in two and sometimes in three degrees, and at each
    stage <i>cahiers</i> or statements of grievances and projects for reform
    were to be drawn up by the electoral assemblies.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> In provinces, where
    there were no royal bailliages or sénéchaussées, and consequently
    no Grand Baillis or Grand Sénéchals to preside, corresponding
    circumscriptions were adopted or invented. During the early months
    of 1789 the French people were fully occupied in the election of the
    deputies to the States-General. Whatever might be the opinion of the
    French Court or the French Ministry, the people,—and more especially
    the educated bourgeois of the towns and the country lawyers,—looked
    upon the future assembly as something more than a financial expedient;
    they trusted to it to draw up a new political system for the State,
    which should admit the representative principle and allow the taxpayer
    a voice not only in the granting, but in the spending of the national
    revenue. The working classes, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>whether in the towns or the rural
    districts, did not take much active interest in the elections, and
    their representatives in the secondary electoral assemblies were
    generally educated bourgeois, but they vaguely built high hopes on the
    meeting of the States-General, and expected it to give them land or
    higher wages. Considering the novelty of choosing representatives in
    France, it is extraordinary that the electoral operations were carried
    out as peacefully and as efficiently as they were. This was mainly
    due to the success of a little revolutionary movement in Dauphiné,
    where an unauthorised and irregular assembly had met in July 1788 to
    protest against the abolition of the provincial Parlements by Loménie
    de Brienne. That minister had left office when he was not permitted
    to put down the assembly in Dauphiné by force, and Necker hoped to
    save the prestige of the monarchy by summoning a new assembly of the
    province in its place. But the ruse was quickly perceived; the men who
    had sat in the illegal assembly were elected to its successor, and in
    the eyes of France the representatives of the Dauphiné had won a signal
    victory over the Court. The new assembly in Dauphiné became the court
    of appeal in every electoral difficulty, and its secretary, Mounier,
    the leader of the Tiers État of France. Owing to his energy and ability
    local jealousies of town against town, province against province,
    class jealousies and personal rivalry, were set at rest, and it was
    more owing to Mounier than to any one else that the deputies to the
    States-General were legally and quietly elected, and that the acts of
    the future assembly could not be stigmatised as the work of a factious
    or unrepresentative minority of the French nation.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Meeting of the States-General.</div>

  <p>On 5th May 1789 the first States-General held in France since the
    year 1614 met at Versailles. Barentin, the Keeper of the Seals, and
    Necker harangued the collected deputies, and the latter explained
    the desperate financial situation of the State and the necessity for
    immediate action to relieve the national treasury. The representatives
    of the nobility and clergy then retired to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span> separate chambers,
    leaving their colleagues of the Tiers État in the great hall. No word
    was spoken about the relation of the three orders to each other.
    It was assumed that each order was to deliberate separately. The
    representatives of the Tiers État were placed in a most difficult
    position. There was no advantage in their being as numerous as
    the two other orders put together, if the three orders were to be
    independent of each other, for in that case the majorities of the
    privileged orders could outweigh the opinion of the majority among
    themselves. The question of <i>vote par ordre</i>, which would give each
    order equal authority, or <i>vote par tête</i>, which would allow the
    numerical preponderance of the Tiers État to take effect, had been
    long recognised as crucial. It had been assumed from the grant of
    double representation to the Tiers État that the Government intended
    to sanction the <i>vote par tête</i>, and the tacit acknowledgment of the
    separation of the orders and consequent recognition of the <i>vote par
      ordre</i> on 5th May disconcerted for the moment the popular leaders.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Struggle between the Orders.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">The Tiers État declare themselves the National Assembly.</div>

  <p>But the deputies of the Tiers État, under the guidance of Le Chapelier,
    a Breton lawyer from Rennes, and of Rabaut de Saint-Étienne, a
    Protestant pastor from Nîmes, proceeded to take up a most skilful
    attitude. They resolved on a policy of masterly inactivity. They
    refused to form themselves into the assembly of the Order of the Tiers
    État; they refused to open letters addressed to them under that title;
    they refused to elect a president or secretaries; and stated that
    they were a body of citizens, representatives of the French nation,
    waiting in that hall to be joined by the other deputies. This attitude
    received the unanimous approval of the people of Paris, and threw upon
    the Government the onus of declaring that the double representation
    of the Tiers État was merely a sterile gift. The representatives of
    the two privileged orders treated the situation very differently. The
    nobility accepted the separation of the orders to distinct chambers,
    and resolved to constitute their chamber<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span> by 188 votes to 47, while the
    clergy only decided in the same sense by 133 votes to 114. Even this
    majority was not really significant. For, owing to a tendency which had
    developed during the course of the elections, the greater part of the
    deputies of the clergy were poor country curés, who sympathised with
    the Tiers État, from which they sprung, and not with the prelates and
    dignitaries of the Church, who belonged to the nobility. This tendency
    of the true majority of the clergy was well known to the leaders of
    the Tiers État and encouraged them in their passive attitude. In
    vain the King and Necker attempted to terminate the deadlock; the
    deputies of the Tiers État persisted that they did not form an order,
    and they were reinforced by the representatives of Paris, where the
    elections were not concluded until the end of May. At last, on 10th
    June, on the proposition of the Abbé Sieyès, deputy for Paris, a final
    invitation was sent to the deputies of the nobility and the clergy to
    join the deputies of the Tiers État, and it was resolved that whether
    the request was granted or refused the Tiers État would constitute
    itself into a regular deliberative body. The invitation was rejected
    by the nobility, and only a few curés, including the Abbé Grégoire,
    belonging to the Order of the Clergy, complied with it. The deputies
    then verified their powers, and elected Bailly, a famous astronomer
    and deputy for Paris, to be their president. But what sort of assembly
    were they? They denied that they were representatives of an Order, and
    they were certainly not the States-General of France. The question was
    hotly debated, and on 16th June they declared themselves the National
    Assembly. They then declared all the taxes, hitherto levied, to be
    illegal, and ordered that they should only be paid provisionally. This
    defiant conduct disconcerted the King and his ministers, and it was
    announced that a Séance Royale, or Royal Session, would be held by the
    King in person to settle all disputed questions.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Oath of the Tennis Court. 20th June.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">The Séance Royale. 23d June.</div>

  <p>On 20th June the deputies of the Tiers État, or of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span> National
    Assembly, as they now termed themselves, were excluded from their usual
    meeting-place. They therefore met in the Jeu de Paume or Tennis Court
    at Versailles, and, amidst a scene of wild excitement, swore that they
    would not separate until they had drawn up a new Constitution for
    France. By this act they practically became rebels, and the French
    Revolution really commenced. On 22d June they met in the Church of
    Saint Louis at Versailles, where they were joined by 149 deputies of
    the clergy, who thus recognised the act of rebellion. On 23d June the
    Séance Royale was held. In the speech from the throne it was announced
    that the King, ‘of his own goodness and generosity,’ would levy no
    taxes in future without the assent of the representatives of the
    people, but it was also declared that the financial privileges of the
    nobility and clergy were unassailable, and that the States-General
    was to vote <i>par ordre</i>. This was the most critical moment in the
    first stage of the Revolution. If the deputies of the Tiers État had
    given way, the oath of the Tennis Court would have seemed only an
    idle threat. But they found a leader in the Comte de Mirabeau, deputy
    for the Tiers État of Aix, a man of extraordinary ability, who in
    the course of a tempestuous career had travelled much and learned
    much. He courageously faced the situation, and after making a reply
    to the Grand Master of the Ceremonies that the deputies of France
    would only be expelled by force, he induced the National Assembly to
    declare the persons of its members inviolable. Sieyès summed up the
    situation by telling the deputies: ‘Gentlemen, you are to-day what
    you were yesterday.’ Before this daring opposition the King gave way:
    on 25th June the minority of the Order of the Nobility, consisting of
    forty-seven deputies, headed by the Marquis de Lafayette, the friend
    of Washington, joined the National Assembly, and two days later the
    majority of that Order reluctantly followed their example at the
    command of the King.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Mirabeau’s Address to the King. 9th July.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Dismissal of Necker. 12th July.</div>

  <p>The rapid transformation of the deputies of the Tiers État<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span> into a
    National Assembly, which defied the royal authority and spoke of
    drawing up a new Constitution for France, exasperated the courtiers,
    who looked with disgust at all attempts to modify the <i>ancien régime</i>.
    The King did not share their feelings; he was honestly desirous of
    doing his duty by his people, and preferred the diminution of his
    royal prerogative to coming into open conflict with his subjects and
    to initiating a civil war. He had hitherto trusted to Necker and
    followed Necker’s advice. But the result had not been encouraging. His
    minister had repeatedly put him in a false position. He had been made
    to speak in a haughty tone to the deputies of the Tiers État at the
    Séance Royale on 23d June, and then to eat his words by directing the
    deputies of the Nobility to join the self-created National Assembly.
    This great concession seemed to have been wrung from him; the deputies
    of the Tiers État appeared to have won a great victory in the face
    of the royal opposition, when in reality the King had yielded from
    the goodness of his heart. Since he found that following the advice
    of Necker had only resulted in a loss of authority, combined with
    profound unpopularity, without improving the financial prospect, Louis
    <span class="smcap">XVI.</span> not unnaturally turned his attention to the enemies of
    the minister. These enemies were headed by the Queen, Marie Antoinette,
    who resented Necker’s endeavours to restrain the extravagance of the
    Court and his admission of the need to make concessions to the will of
    the people, and by the King’s younger brother, the Comte d’Artois, a
    staunch supporter of the absolute prerogative of the Crown and of the
    system of the <i>ancien régime</i>. Yielding unwillingly to the arguments of
    the enemies of Necker and of the National Assembly, the King determined
    to use force, and he began to concentrate troops in the neighbourhood
    of Paris and Versailles. The National Assembly did not know what to
    do; Mounier and other leaders had formed a committee to draw up the
    bases of a new constitution; but they had no force on which they could
    depend to resist the royal troops, and felt that they would probably be
    arrested and the Assembly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span> dissolved long before the foundation of the
    Constitution was laid. At this crisis Mirabeau again came to the front.
    With the most daring audacity he attacked and revealed the policy of
    the Court on 8th July, and on 9th July carried an address to the King
    on the part of the Assembly, requesting the immediate removal of the
    troops collected in the neighbourhood, but protesting the loyalty of
    the Assembly to the person of the King. But the King was now under the
    influence of the opponents of the Assembly. His answer to Mirabeau’s
    address was the dismissal of Necker and his colleagues on 12th July,
    the banishment of Necker, and the appointment of the Maréchal de
    Broglie, an experienced general, who detested the idea of change, to be
    Minister for War and Marshal-General of the troops in the neighbourhood
    of Paris.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Formation of National Guards.</div>

  <p>Hitherto the struggle had been between the Court and the deputies of
    the Tiers État; the popular element was now to intervene; and the
    people of Paris was for the first time to make its influence felt. The
    news of Necker’s dismissal was received in Paris with wrath and dismay.
    A young lawyer without practice, named Camille Desmoulins, announced
    the event to the crowd collected in the Palais Royal and incited his
    hearers to resistance. His words were eagerly applauded. The population
    of Paris, both bourgeois and proletariat, had watched the course of
    events at Versailles with unflagging interest, and the formation of a
    camp of soldiers in the neighbourhood with terror. The working classes,
    who lived near the margin of starvation, expected that the National
    Assembly would cause in some way a rise in wages and a decrease in
    the price of necessaries, and were exasperated at the prospect of the
    non-fulfilment of their hopes. They had already sacked the house of a
    manufacturer, named Réveillon, who was reported to have spoken scornful
    words of their poverty, on 28th April, and were ready for any mischief.
    From the Palais Royal, excited by the news and the words of Camille
    Desmoulins, started a tumultuous procession bearing busts of Necker
    and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span> of the Duke of Orleans, a prince of the royal house, who had been
    exiled by the King for previous opposition to him, and who was regarded
    as a supporter of the popular claims. The procession was charged by a
    German cavalry regiment in the French service, commanded by the Prince
    de Lambesc, a near relative of the Queen, and the mob dispersed to riot
    and to pillage. The more patriotic rioters broke into the gunsmiths’
    shops to seize weapons, the rest pillaged the butchers’ and bakers’
    shops, and burned the barriers where octroi duties were collected. This
    scene of riot brought about its own remedy. The bourgeois, terrified
    for the safety of their shops, took up arms, and on the following
    day formed themselves into companies of national guards for the
    preservation of the peace. The guidance of this movement was taken by
    the electors of Paris, who, after completing their work of electing
    deputies for Paris, continued to meet at the Hôtel-de-Ville.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Capture of the Bastille. 14th July.</div>

  <p>The 14th of July found the capital of France organised for resistance.
    The Gardes Françaises, the force maintained for the security of Paris,
    were devoted to the cause of the National Assembly, and were resolved
    to fight with the people, not against them. And it was ascertained
    that the soldiers in the camp were very lukewarm in their attachment
    to their officers, and were likely to refuse to attack the citizens.
    Under these circumstances an idea arose that an armed demonstration of
    the Parisians at Versailles would strengthen the King, whose sentiments
    were well known, to resist the Court party and to recall Necker. With
    this notion, large crowds approached the Hôtel des Invalides and the
    Bastille, the two principal store-houses of arms in Paris. The crowd,
    which went to the Hôtel des Invalides, had no difficulty in seizing
    the arms there, in spite of the opposition of the Governor. But it was
    otherwise at the Bastille. The mob, which collected in the Governor’s
    Court in that fortress and shouted for arms, was isolated by the
    raising of the outer drawbridge and fired upon by the weak garrison
    in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span> the Bastille itself. The sound of this firing brought a number of
    armed men from other parts of the city; the outer drawbridge was cut
    down, and preparations were being made to force a way into the fortress
    itself, when the garrison surrendered. The result of the firing upon
    the mob in the Governor’s Court had been to kill eighty-three persons
    and wound many others. The sight of the corpses and the cries of the
    wounded excited the anger of the successful conquerors of the fortress.
    A panic arose, and three officers and four soldiers of the garrison
    were murdered. Then the more disciplined of the conquerors started to
    take the rest of the defenders of the Bastille to the Hôtel-de-Ville.
    On the way the Governor and the Major of the fortress were murdered by
    the mob, and M. de Flesselles, the Provost of the merchants of Paris,
    who was accused of encouraging the Governor to resist, was also slain.
    By these events the people of Paris felt that they had commenced a
    war against the Crown; entrenchments were thrown up and barricades
    were erected in the streets; all shops were shut up; the barriers were
    closed; no one was allowed to leave the city, and preparations were
    made to stand a siege.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Recall of Necker. 15th July.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">The King’s visit to Paris. 17th July.</div>

  <p>But if the people of Paris were ready to fight, the King was not. As
    has been said, he loathed the idea of civil war, and when he heard of
    the capture of the Bastille and of the martial attitude of Paris, he
    at once gave up the idea of opposing the revolutionary movement by
    force. He dismissed his reactionary ministers and recalled Necker, and
    he declared himself ready to co-operate with the National Assembly
    in restoring order. The first victories of the Assembly had been won
    by its statesmanlike inaction in the month of May and its courage on
    23d June; the victory over the party of force had been won by Paris
    on 14th July. The Assembly prepared to take advantage of this fresh
    success. On 16th July it legalised the establishment of National Guards
    and elective municipalities all over France, and recognising that the
    only way to convince the Parisians that the King had accepted the new
    situation and had abandoned the idea of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span> employing force, was to induce
    the King to visit Paris in person, it proposed that he should do so
    at once. Louis <span class="smcap">XVI.</span> was not devoid of personal courage, and
    consented. On 17th July, accordingly, he entered Paris accompanied by
    100 deputies, and amidst wild acclamation put on the tricolour cockade,
    which the Parisians had assumed as their badge, and consented to the
    nomination of Bailly, the President of the National Assembly, to be
    Mayor of Paris, and of Lafayette to be Commander-in-chief of the Paris
    National Guard. These concessions, and the victory of the National
    Assembly and of Paris threw consternation among the court party of
    reaction: the Comte d’Artois and those of his adherents, who were most
    hated as conspicuous reactionaries or who had advocated the employment
    of force, fled from the country.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Murder of Foullon. 21st July.</div>

  <p>The immediate results of the capture of the Bastille were no less
    important in the provinces of France. In every city, even in small
    country towns, mayors and municipalities were elected and National
    Guards formed; in many the local citadels were seized by the people;
    in all the troops fraternised with the people; and in some there was
    bloodshed. This movement was essentially bourgeois; where blood was
    shed and pillage took place at the hands of the working classes, the
    new National Guards soon restored order. The general excitement was so
    great that it is surprising that there was not more bloodshed and that
    peace was so quickly and efficiently established. Among these outbreaks
    the most noteworthy took place in Paris itself, where on 21st July
    Foullon de Doué, who had been nominated to succeed Necker on 12th July,
    and his son-in-law Berthier de Sauvigny were murdered almost before the
    eyes of Bailly, the new Mayor of Paris. But these occasional town riots
    were speedily quelled by the armed bourgeois. Far more widespread and
    important was the upheaval in the rural districts of France.</p>

  <p>The peasants believed that the time had come, when they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span> were to
    own their land free from copyhold rights or the relics of feudal
    servitudes. Even the better-educated farmers for their own interests
    favoured this idea. The result was a regular jacquerie in many
    parts of France. The châteaux of the lords were burnt, or in some
    instances only the charters stored in them, and the lords’ dovecotes
    and rabbit-warrens were generally destroyed. In certain provinces
    the National Guards of the neighbouring towns put down these rural
    outbreaks, occasionally with great severity, but as a rule they ran
    their course unchecked.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Session of 4th August.</div>

  <p>On 4th August a deputy named Salomon read a report on these occurrences
    to the National Assembly, or as it is generally called from the
    Constitution it framed, the Constituent Assembly. His report was
    followed by a curious scene, which marked the transition from feudal
    to modern France. The scene was opened by the sacrifice by some of the
    young liberal noblemen of their feudal rights. Privileges of all sorts,
    privileges of class, of town and of province were solemnly abandoned.
    Feudal customs and all relics of feudalism were condemned and declared
    to be abolished. Even tithes were swept away, in spite of a protest
    from Sieyès, and the ‘orgie,’ as Mirabeau termed it, closed with a
    decree that a monument should be erected to Louis <span class="smcap">XVI.</span>, ‘the
    restorer of French liberty.’</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Declaration of the Rights of Man.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">The Suspensive Veto.</div>

  <p>But it was not possible to restore peace and prosperity to France
    by the abolition of the relics of feudalism. Destruction of former
    anomalies and of a crumbling system of government would inevitably lead
    to anarchy, unless accompanied by the construction of a new scheme of
    central and local administration. It was here that the Constituent
    Assembly failed. The deputies were quick to destroy but slow to
    construct. For two months they wasted time instead of hastening to draw
    up a new constitution for France. They first wrangled over the wording
    of a Declaration of the Rights of Man, which they resolved to compile
    in imitation of the founders of the American Republic. They then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
    debated lengthily whether the future representative assembly of France
    should consist of one or two chambers, and whether the King should have
    power to veto its acts. The first question was decided in favour of a
    single chamber, more because the English Constitution sanctioned two
    chambers, and the deputies feared to be thought imitators, than for
    any logical reason. And the debate on the second question terminated
    in the grant to the King of a suspensive veto for six months, in spite
    of the eloquence of Mirabeau, who saw that a monarchical constitution,
    which gave the King no more power than the President of the United
    States of America, would prove unworkable, because it would divorce
    responsibility from real authority, leaving the former to the King and
    the latter to the Legislature.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The King brought to Paris. 6th October.</div>

  <p>During the two months occupied by these debates the situation had
    again become critical. Necker’s only idea to relieve the financial
    situation was to propose loans, which the Assembly granted, but which
    he could not succeed in raising. The King was again being acted
    upon by the Court party, which advocated the use of force and the
    dissolution of the Assembly, and this party was encouraged by the
    Queen and by the King’s sister, Madame Elizabeth. He was also urged
    to leave the neighbourhood of Paris and to establish himself in some
    provincial town, where the populace could be more easily restrained
    by the regular troops. He would not heartily agree to either of these
    courses, but weakly consented once more to concentrate troops round his
    person. Everything advised at Versailles was soon known in Paris. The
    journalists, who had since the capture of the Bastille sprung up in the
    capital to advocate the views of the popular party, and of whom the
    ablest were Loustalot, editor of the <i>Révolutions de Paris</i>, and Marat,
    editor of the <i>Ami du Peuple</i>, kept warning the people of Paris against
    treason on the part of the King, and prophesying dire consequences if
    he were allowed to leave the neighbourhood or to concentrate troops.
    Their words did not fall on unheeding ears. The working classes feared
    a siege of Paris<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span> again as they had done in July, and looked on the
    King’s presence in Paris as the only means to keep down the price
    of necessaries. The thinking bourgeois, whether liberal deputies in
    the Assembly or national guards in Paris, feared a sudden forced
    dissolution of the Assembly, and not only the loss of the advantages
    they had gained but punishment for the part they had played. Both
    these elements were perceptible in the movement which followed. The
    description given in the popular journals of a banquet at Versailles,
    honoured by the presence of the royal family, at which the national
    cockade had been trampled underfoot, on 1st October, roused the people
    of Paris to a frenzy of wrath and fear. On 5th October a crowd of women
    collected in Paris, declaring that they were starving, and were led to
    Versailles by Maillard, one of the conquerors of the Bastille, followed
    by a mob. The representatives of the women interviewed the King, and
    the mob prepared to spend the night outside the palace walls. Late at
    night they were followed by a powerful detachment of the National Guard
    of Paris, under the command of Lafayette, who protested that he came to
    save the King. Nevertheless, owing to bad management, some of the mob
    broke into the palace before daybreak on the morning of 6th October and
    murdered two of the royal bodyguards. Lafayette came to the rescue and
    demanded that the King and royal family should come to Paris and take
    up their residence at the Tuileries. The King, horrified by the events
    of the morning, and obliged to obey Lafayette, consented, and the royal
    family, accompanied by the mob, and escorted by the National Guard, at
    once proceeded to the capital. This second victory of the Parisians was
    not less important than the first: on 14th July the people of Paris had
    terrified the King into abandoning the idea of dissolving the National
    Assembly by force; on 6th October they brought him amongst them, so
    that if he again conceived the idea, he would be unable to execute it.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Effect in Europe.</div>

  <p>The capture of the Bastille caused the most profound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span> astonishment in
    Europe. Where the people possessed some amount of political liberty,
    as in the United States of America and in England, it appealed to the
    imagination, and the French were regarded as the conquerors of their
    freedom. In the neighbourhood of France, in the Rhenish principalities,
    in Belgium, and above all in Liège, it caused a general sense of
    discontent and even riots. The despotic monarchs of Europe and their
    principal ministers did not pay so much attention to the capture of
    the Bastille as did the inhabitants of free countries; they did not
    for one moment believe that the National Assembly would be allowed to
    alter the old constitution of France, and looked upon the whole of the
    popular movement with a favourable eye as likely to weaken France and
    prevent her from interfering in the affairs of the Continent. They took
    care, however, to suppress all similar risings in their own states. The
    King of Sardinia and the Elector of Mayence were especially severe;
    the Emperor’s General d’Alton was more than severe in Belgium; and the
    King of Prussia sent General Schlieffen with a strong force to restore
    the authority of the Bishop of Liège. This attitude of the continental
    monarchs was encouraged by the first French <i>émigrés</i>, who loudly
    declared that the success of the Assembly was due to the culpable
    weakness of Louis <span class="smcap">XVI.</span></p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Belgian Revolution. Oct. 1789-Jan. 1790.</div>

  <p>The tidings of the events of 5th and 6th October showed both the French
    <i>émigrés</i> and the continental monarchs that they were wrong in their
    estimate of the Revolution. That the French royal family should be
    triumphantly brought to Paris and be practically imprisoned in the
    Tuileries under the eyes of the Parisian populace was a startling
    proof of the power of the people. It proportionately encouraged the
    supporters of all the popular movements on the French borders. Of
    these, the most important was that which had already made so much
    progress two years before in Belgium. The first result of the removal
    of the King of France to Paris was the Belgian Revolution of 1789,
    which filled almost as large a place in the eyes of contemporaries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
    as the French Revolution itself. Encouraged by the Triple Alliance,
    and more especially by Frederick William <span class="smcap">II.</span> of Prussia, the
    Belgian exiles of both wings, the supporters of Van der Noot, the
    advocate of the ancient Constitution, and of Vonck, the radical, had
    formed a patriotic army at Breda. The news of the events of 5th and 6th
    October determined them to act. On 23d October the army under Van der
    Mersch crossed the border, and on 24th October Van der Noot issued a
    manifesto declaring the Emperor Joseph deprived of his sovereignty over
    the Duchy of Brabant for having violated its fundamental charter.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Formation of the Belgian Republic, 10th Jan. 1790.</div>

  <p>The march of the patriotic army was both rapid and successful. Bruges
    and Ostend opened their gates to the exiles; the fort of St. Pierre
    at Ghent was stormed; and the Estates of Flanders at once assembled,
    published a declaration of independence, and called on the other
    provinces to join in the movement. In Brabant the excitement was at
    its height. Trautmannsdorf in vain promised to restore the ‘Joyeuse
    Entrée,’ to abolish the Imperial Seminary at Brussels, and to declare a
    general amnesty. The patriots would not trust him, and Van der Mersch
    advanced into the Duchy and occupied Tirlemont. The people of Brussels
    then rose in insurrection. From 7th to 12th December was a period of
    long-continued riot and street fighting. Many of the Austrian soldiers
    deserted to the popular side, and those who remained true to their
    colours were shot at from windows and refused to charge. The advance
    of Van der Mersch set the seal upon d’Alton’s discomfiture. He made a
    capitulation on 12th December, and marched out of Brussels, leaving
    his guns, military stores, and military chest containing 3,000,000
    florins behind. He retreated to Luxembourg, the only province which
    remained faithful to the House of Austria, and his example was followed
    by the imperial garrisons of Malines, Antwerp, and Louvain, which
    were abandoned to the patriots. D’Alton himself died at Trèves, it is
    said by taking poison, on being summoned to Vienna to be tried by a
    court-martial, and was succeeded in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span> command of the Austrian troops in
    Luxembourg by General Bender. On 18th December the patriot committee
    entered Brussels, headed by Van der Noot, who was hailed by the people
    as the Belgian Franklin. On 7th January 1790 representatives from all
    the provinces of the former Austrian Netherlands met at Brussels under
    the presidency of Cardinal Frankenberg, Archbishop of Malines, and
    on 10th January they passed a federal constitution for the ‘United
    Belgian States,’ resembling that of Holland, under which each province
    was to preserve its internal independence, and only foreign affairs
    and national defence were left to the central government. Van der Noot
    was chosen Minister of State, and he at once asked for the official
    recognition of the new Belgian Constitution by the Triple Alliance,
    whose ministers at the Hague, Lord Auckland, Count Keller, and Van der
    Spiegel had, he asserted, promised to guarantee the independence of
    the new United States of Belgium. Frederick William <span class="smcap">II.</span> of
    Prussia endeavoured to carry out this promise. He authorised one of his
    officers, General Schönfeld, to organise the Belgian army, and ordered
    General Schlieffen at Liége to enter into communication with the new
    government. But England and Holland, though approving the insurrection
    of Belgium as affording a powerful counterpoise to the Emperor’s policy
    in the East, were in no hurry to guarantee the new Republic, and Van
    der Noot then determined, under the influence of the radicals or
    Vonckists, to solicit the help of France, and announced the new Belgian
    Constitution in a significant manner both to Louis <span class="smcap">XVI.</span> and to
    the President of the National Assembly.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Death of the Emperor Joseph. 20th Feb. 1790.</div>

  <p>The news of the declaration of the independence of the Belgian
    provinces, and of the revolution which had led to it, proved to be the
    death-blow of the Emperor Joseph. To the Prince de Ligne, a native
    of Belgium, he said, just before his death, ‘Your country has killed
    me; the taking of Ghent is my agony; the evacuation of Brussels is
    my death. What a disgrace this is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span> for me! I die; I must be made of
    wood, if I did not. Go to the Netherlands; make them return to their
    allegiance. If you do not succeed in the attempt, remain there. Do not
    sacrifice your fortune for me; you have children.’ The dying Emperor
    in his despair made concessions in every direction. He humbled his
    pride to entreat the Pope to use his influence with the Belgian clergy.
    He gave in to the Hungarian magnates, who demanded the repeal of his
    great reforms with threats of insurrection; and on 28th January 1790 he
    issued his ‘Revocatio Ordinationum quæ sensu communi legibus adversari
    videbantur,’ by which he revoked all his reforms in Hungary, except
    the edict of toleration and the decrees against serfdom; and on 18th
    February he ordered the Crown of St. Stephen to be sent back to Pesth.
    He assented to the suspension of his reforming edicts in Bohemia, and
    even in the Tyrol, where an insurrection was on the point of breaking
    out. Then, feeling his life a failure, he prepared for death. He
    confessed and received the ordinances of the Church; the last words
    he was heard to say were: ‘I believe I have done my duty as a man and
    a prince,’ and on the morning of 20th February he died. The words he
    wished to be written on his grave were: ‘Here rests a prince, whose
    intentions were pure; but who had the misfortune to see all his plans
    miscarry;’ but the people of Vienna, with a deeper sense of the merits
    of the great ruler who had lived in their midst, placed on his statue
    the inscription, ‘Josepho secundo, arduis nato, magnis perfuncto,
    majoribus præcepto, qui saluti publicæ vixit non diu, sed totus.’
    The failure of the career of Joseph, the noblest sovereign of the
    eighteenth century,—one of the noblest sovereigns of any century,—was
    a proof of the fallacy of the eighteenth century conception of
    benevolent despotism. He had tried to accomplish in his dominions the
    very measures of reform which the Constituent Assembly had undertaken
    in France. The abolition of the relics of feudalism, the creation of a
    spirit of nationality, based upon the existence of uniform laws, the
    nationalisation of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span> Church and of education, the removal of all
    caste privileges, whether in the payment of taxes or in eligibility for
    public employment, and the maintenance of good internal administration,
    the primary aims and the great achievements of the Revolution in
    France, were also the objects of Joseph’s reforms. But everything was
    to be done for the people, nothing by the people, and it is doubtful
    whether, if Joseph had been in the place of Louis <span class="smcap">XVI.</span>,
    the French people would have relished the advantages he might have
    conferred. The spirit of locality was perhaps not so strong in France
    as in the hereditary dominions of the House of Austria. Dauphiné and
    Burgundy did not differ from Brittany and Normandy as much as Bohemia
    and Hungary, Belgium and the Milanese differed from each other. Yet the
    abolition of local distinctions might have been resented in France,
    as it was in the dominions of Joseph, if it had been accomplished by
    the monarch, instead of being the work of elected representatives.
    It is indeed remarkable that, allowing for the want of exactness in
    the parallel, owing to the difference of local conditions, the very
    reforms, which rallied all France to the side of the Revolution,
    should have led to the disastrous termination of the Emperor Joseph’s
    reign, and it is difficult to avoid coming to the conclusion that the
    whole subject illustrates the grand distinction between the eighteenth
    and the nineteenth centuries, the distinction between alterations in
    the political, social, or economical conditions of a state made by a
    monarch for his people, and by a people for itself.</p>

  <p>Louis <span class="smcap">XVI.</span>, indeed, showed himself a very different type of
    monarch from Joseph. He wished for the good of his people as ardently
    as his brother-in-law, but he had during the early years of his reign
    been satisfied with wishing for reforms, instead of energetically
    initiating them. When the success of the Revolution was assured by
    the policy of the deputies of the Tiers État, by the capture of the
    Bastille and by his own establishment at Paris, he never thought of
    setting himself at the head of the party of reform. He did not openly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
    ally himself with the Tiers État, to vanquish the opposition of the
    nobles, as Gustavus <span class="smcap">III.</span> of Sweden had done; he did not dream
    of outbidding the National Assembly for popularity by lavish promises,
    as other monarchs before and since have done; and he did not even try
    to share the credit of the representatives of the people by exhibiting
    an ardent zeal for reform. The horror he felt for civil war was not
    recognised; his partial yielding to the Court party of reaction in
    July and October, though at so late a date and so half-heartedly as
    to nullify any chance of its success, was imputed to him as a crime;
    and the difficulty presented by the fact that his dearest relatives,
    his Queen, Marie Antoinette, and his sister, Madame Elizabeth, were
    against all reform, was never fully appreciated. In consequence, the
    King’s real wishes to please his people and avoid bloodshed were looked
    on as simulated by the members of the National Assembly, and not only
    Louis himself, but the very principle of the French monarchy, were
    regarded as hostile to representative institutions. Louis <span class="smcap">XVI.</span>
    was as weak as Joseph <span class="smcap">II.</span> was energetic, but he was equally
    well-intentioned; and it was a distinct misfortune, both for himself
    and for France, that the value of the passive inertness, which he
    generally opposed to the reactionary schemes of his family and of the
    partisans of the <i>ancien régime</i>, was not adequately recognised.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The New French Constitution. 1789–1791.</div>

  <p>This attitude towards the King had an important effect upon the
    constitution which the Constituent Assembly was engaged in framing
    during the year 1790. Only the main points in the growth of this
    Constitution, which occupied the greater part of the time of the
    Assembly from 1789 to 1791, can here be touched upon. But one striking
    feature must first be observed, that it was drawn up and applied
    piecemeal, not as an organic whole, like the later French constitutions
    of the revolutionary period. The first important principle was decreed
    upon 12th November 1789, when it was resolved that all the old local
    divisions of France, which perpetuated the memory of the gradual
    growth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span> of the French provinces into France, should be abolished, and
    that the country should be divided into eighty departments of nearly
    equal size. It was naturally some months before the new division
    was effected, and still longer before the further division of each
    department into districts, and each district into cantons was finished.
    No wiser step for converting France from a congeries of provinces into
    a nation could have been devised. On the basis of the new divisions
    a new local government was established. Each department and district
    was to be administered by elected authorities, elaborately chosen by a
    system of double election. Next to the local government, the judicial
    system was reorganised. The Parlements were all abolished, and local
    courts, consisting of elected judges of departmental and district
    tribunals, and elected justices of the peace, were substituted. A
    uniform system of law was projected, and juries were sanctioned in
    criminal but not in civil cases. In these sweeping reforms one natural
    blemish is perceptible: from having no elected officials the other
    extreme was adopted of having all officials elected.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Civil Constitution of the Clergy.</div>

  <p>The mania for election affected the reform of the ecclesiastical
    arrangements of France, and directly brought about the schism, which
    so largely contributed to the misfortunes of France during the
    revolutionary period. On 2d November 1789 it had been resolved, in
    the face of the financial distress, that the property of the Church
    in France should be confiscated or resumed, as it was represented by
    opposite parties, while acknowledging the duty of providing and paying
    curés and bishops. This implied the formation of a State Church, a
    measure which needed the most delicate handling. On 13th February 1790
    all monasteries and religious houses were suppressed; but as there had
    already been a partial suppression a few years previously, this would
    not by itself have caused a schism. It was otherwise with regard to the
    Civil Constitution of the Clergy. It was resolved to reduce the number
    of bishoprics to one for each department, and that all the beneficed
    clergy, from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span> curés to bishops, should be elected. This violation of
    a fundamental principle of the Catholic Church could not be allowed
    to pass unchallenged, and when the Constituent Assembly found that
    opposition was raised, it drove matters to a crisis by ordering that
    every beneficed ecclesiastic should take an oath to observe the new
    Civil Constitution of the Clergy. This oath was generally refused by
    the bishops and dignitaries, and largely by the parochial clergy, and
    it was resolved by the Assembly, on 27th November 1790, that all who
    refused the oath within one week should be held to be dismissed from
    their offices. The King sanctioned this decree on 26th December 1790,
    and the great schism in France began. It was doubtful at first whether
    apostolical succession could be preserved in the new Church of France.
    Only four beneficed bishops, including Loménie de Brienne, Cardinal
    Archbishop of Sens, and Talleyrand, Bishop of Autun, out of one hundred
    and thirty-five, and three coadjutor bishops, or bishops <i>in partibus</i>,
    including Gobel, Bishop of Lydda, consented to take the oath, but
    by them the first of the elected bishops of departmental sees were
    consecrated.</p>

  <p>The measures of the Constituent Assembly in abolishing the old
    provincial divisions and law courts, and substituting new and more
    modern arrangements for administration, were in the nature of great
    reforms, though marred by the mania for election; the attempt to
    establish a Gallican Church, though obviously opposed to the discipline
    of the Catholic Church, and seriously discounted by the same mania,
    was patriotic, if not very wise; but the arrangements for the central
    administration were utterly absurd. In their dislike of the system
    of the <i>ancien régime</i>, and their fear of a strong executive, the
    Constituent Assembly thought it could not do enough to hamper the
    authority of the throne and of the central administration. The King,
    under the new Constitution, was left powerless. He was to be the first
    functionary of the State, nothing more. His veto on the measures of the
    Legislature was to have effect for only six months; his guards were
    suppressed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span> and his position made untenable for a strong monarch, and
    unbearable for a weak one. The ministers were invested with supreme
    executive authority, but more regulations were made to ensure their
    responsibility and limit their actual power, than to define their
    functions. They were to be answerable to the Legislature, in which they
    were not allowed to sit; and their measures were to be criticised by
    an irresponsible representative assembly. Under such regulations the
    King and his ministers, that is, the executive, were put in a position
    of inferiority, which no vigorous man could be expected to accept, to
    the inevitable derangement of the whole administrative machine. In
    addition to the Constitution, the Constituent Assembly carried several
    measures of the greatest importance to a free state. All citizens,
    of whatever religion or class, were declared eligible for employment
    by the State; and on 13th April 1790 a noble decree, declaring the
    most absolute and entire toleration of every form of religion, was
    carried. The Constitution of 1791 was, on the whole, a praiseworthy
    effort of untried legislators to give their country a representative
    constitution. It was marred only by the fatal jealousy of giving due
    authority to the executive, and the mania for election. But it was
    in no way democratic. For the election to all offices was to be by
    at least two degrees, and no man was to have a vote unless he was an
    ‘active citizen.’ To be an active citizen, a man had to contribute to
    the direct taxation of the country an amount equivalent in value to
    three days’ wages in his locality. Further, to be eligible for office,
    a candidate had to pay taxes of the value of a ‘silver mark,’ which
    inevitably restricted all offices to the bourgeois, or very prosperous
    working men.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Other acts of the Constituent Assembly.</div>

  <p>Though the main occupation of the Constituent Assembly was the
    building up of the Constitution of 1791, it interfered only too much
    in matters of current administration. It was soon obvious that its
    power exceeded that of the King, and it has been observed that Van der
    Noot announced the new Belgian Constitution alike to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span> King and the
    President of the Assembly, as to authorities of equal importance. The
    mischief produced by this constant interference was perceptible in
    every department of government. Mirabeau, who was a profound master of
    statecraft, saw through the fallacies of endeavouring to separate the
    legislative and executive powers in the State, and, what was implied
    in the preponderance of a legislature in which the ministers had no
    seat, to divorce authority from responsibility. He understood and
    approved of the English system, and as soon as the Constituent Assembly
    had removed to Paris in October 1789, after the establishment of the
    King at the Tuileries, and he had got the ear of the Court through his
    friend, La Marck, Mirabeau proposed the formation of a constitutional
    ministry, after the English fashion, from among the leading members of
    the Assembly. His scheme got noised abroad: the Assembly in its fear
    of the executive, which was afterwards consecrated in the Constitution
    of 1791, and stimulated by Lafayette, who dreaded the influence of a
    strong ministry, passed a motion on 7th November, that no member of the
    Assembly could take office as a minister while he remained a deputy, or
    for three years after his resignation.</p>

  <p>The spirit, which lay at the root of this decree, showed itself in
    other ways. The fear of the influence of the Crown extended itself
    to the army and navy, as the natural instruments of the Crown for
    re-establishing its former authority. The army, already disorganised by
    the emigration of many of its officers, was practically destroyed in
    its efficiency as a fighting machine by the relaxation of discipline
    among the soldiers, caused not only by the actual decrees of the
    Assembly, but by the impunity allowed to desertion and mutiny. The
    Marquis de Bouillé, the general commanding at Metz, did indeed put
    down a military mutiny at Nancy on 31st August 1790, but his action,
    though applauded by the Assembly, which could not openly encourage
    mutiny, was isolated and not imitated. In the navy matters were even
    more desperate, for a larger proportion of officers deserted, resigned,
    or emigrated than in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span> the army, and loss of discipline is even more
    disastrous in a naval than in a military force. The weakness of the
    army was intended to be compensated by the enrolment of national
    guards. But these citizen soldiers could not be treated with the
    strictness of regular troops. They were chiefly of the bourgeois class,
    and had the prejudices of that class, caring more for the protection of
    their property than for military efficiency. In Paris they were of the
    most importance, owing to their numbers, and their commander-in-chief,
    Lafayette, probably the most powerful man in France in 1790. The
    framing of the Constitution, and the disorganisation of the central
    authority and its instruments were the chief results of the labours of
    the Constituent Assembly in 1790; but among its minor acts should be
    noted the abolition of titles of nobility, liveries and other relics of
    social pre-eminence on 13th July 1790, as an evidence of its desire to
    extirpate even the outward signs of the <i>ancien régime</i>.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Mirabeau.</div>

  <p>Only one man seems to have understood the dangers to which France
    was drifting owing to the policy of the Constituent Assembly, and
    that man was Mirabeau. He had done more than any man to assure the
    victory of the Tiers État in June 1789; he was the greatest orator and
    greatest statesman the revolutionary crisis had produced. Mirabeau,
    however, hated anarchy as much as he did despotism. He saw the absolute
    necessity of establishing a strong executive, if the crisis of 1789,
    the dissolution of the old authorities, the unpunished riots in towns,
    and the jacquerie in the rural districts were not to lead to anarchy.
    Foiled in his prudent scheme of selecting a strong ministry from the
    Constituent Assembly<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> by the vote of 7th November 1789, Mirabeau
    saw that it was impossible to overcome the distrust of the Assembly
    for the executive. He therefore turned to the Court, and in May 1790
    he became the secret adviser of the King through the mediation of
    his friend La Marck. In a series of memoirs <span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>or notes for the Court
    of surpassing political wisdom, Mirabeau analysed the situation of
    affairs and proposed remedies. The two main dangers were the state of
    the finances and the fear of foreign intervention. Mirabeau’s horror
    of national bankruptcy was as great as his personal extravagance in
    expenditure. In September 1789 he advocated Necker’s scheme of a
    general contribution, though it was accompanied by stipulations which
    were certain to make it almost entirely unproductive, and he personally
    disapproved of it; in December 1789 he grudgingly acquiesced in the
    first issue of ‘assignats’ or promises to pay, based on the value of
    the property of the Church, resumed or confiscated by the Assembly,
    and to be extinguished as this property was sold. In August 1790
    he went yet further. Comprehending that men are mainly influenced
    by their pecuniary interests, he advocated a wide extension of the
    system of assignats, down to small sums, on the grounds that they
    would then be able to reach the hands of the poorer classes and give
    them an interest in their maintaining their value, and would also
    frustrate the machinations of speculators, who began to make money by
    depreciating the exchange of specie against the new paper currency. But
    he also wisely proposed and successfully carried severe regulations
    for the extinction of assignats as the national property was realised,
    regulations which, unfortunately, were not strictly observed. His
    decree was followed in September 1790 by the retirement of Necker from
    office, and it is a significant proof of the change in popular opinion
    that the final retirement of the minister, whose dismissal in July 1789
    had brought about the capture of the Bastille, was received without
    excitement.</p>

  <p>The other great danger which France incurred, by the disorganising
    policy of the Constituent Assembly, was the possibility of the armed
    intervention of foreign powers. Mirabeau thought that if national
    bankruptcy and the interference of foreigners could be avoided, the
    anarchy, which was making itself felt, might soon be quelled. He did
    not fear civil war; indeed, he argued that it might be a positive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
    advantage, and that as long as the King did not retract his concession
    of a representative constitution, a large portion of his subjects
    would support him in winning back the legitimate authority of the
    executive. But foreign war was to him an evil to be feared as much as
    national bankruptcy. He knew the spirit of his countrymen well, and
    that they would in case of national disaster submit to any despotism
    rather than submit to the dictation or the interference of a foreign
    power in their internal affairs. Success in a foreign war owing to the
    state of the army was not to be expected, but if it did come, it would
    with almost equal certainty lead to the despotism of the conquering
    government, whether it were the reigning monarch, his successor, or a
    victorious general. To avoid a foreign war it was necessary as far as
    possible to leave the conduct of foreign affairs in the hands of the
    King. This was Mirabeau’s intention in the great debate on the right
    of declaring peace and war in May 1790, and he succeeded in getting
    the Assembly to sanction the initiation of peace or war as part of the
    duties of the King. But at this period Louis <span class="smcap">XVI.</span> was too weak
    or too unwilling to understand the paramount necessity of maintaining
    peace. Mirabeau, therefore, got himself elected to a special Diplomatic
    Committee of the Constituent Assembly, and as its reporter endeavoured
    throughout the year 1790 to keep France clear of international
    complications.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Mirabeau and the Court.</div>

  <p>Unfortunately neither Louis <span class="smcap">XVI.</span> nor his ministers, and still
    less Marie Antoinette, grasped the truth of Mirabeau’s memoirs for
    the Court. On the contrary, the one idea of the Queen was to get her
    brother, the Emperor Leopold, to interfere, and, if necessary, by force
    of arms to restore the power of the French monarch. The King, too, was
    startled at Mirabeau’s ideas; he felt no horror at the notion of a
    foreign war, but would suffer anything rather than engage in a civil
    war. The wise advice of the great statesman went unheeded; both King
    and Queen regarded their connection with him as the clever muzzling of
    a dangerous revolutionary leader. They could not comprehend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span> his desire
    to establish a strong executive for the sake of France, and looked
    on it as a bit of personal ambition. The King was not sufficiently
    far-seeing, nor the Queen sufficiently patriotic to understand his
    views. If the Constituent Assembly distrusted the Court, the King and
    Queen no less strongly distrusted Mirabeau.</p>

  <p>As reporter of the Diplomatic Committee, Mirabeau had three different
    problems to solve, in which the policy of the Assembly came in contact
    with foreign powers, the affairs of Avignon, the maintenance of the
    Pacte de Famille with Spain, and the interference caused by the
    legislation of the Assembly with the Princes of the Empire who owned
    fiefs of the Empire in Alsace.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Avignon and the Venaissin.</div>

  <p>The city of Avignon and the county of the Venaissin, though inhabited
    by Frenchmen and surrounded by French territory, were under the
    sovereignty of the Pope. As early as the ‘orgie’ of 4th August 1789
    the Constituent Assembly had pronounced on the expediency of uniting
    both the city and the county with France. A French party was formed in
    Avignon; and a free municipal constitution after the model of those
    just established in France was framed and assented to by the Cardinal
    Vice-Legate in April 1790. The Pope, however, annulled his deputy’s
    assent, with the result that fierce street fighting took place in the
    city, which was only stopped by the intervention of the National Guard
    of the neighbouring French city of Orange. The result of these events
    was that the city of Avignon, or at least the French party there,
    declared Avignon united to France on 12th June 1790. The inhabitants
    of the Venaissin, on the other hand, declared their attachment for the
    Pope, and their wish to remain subject to him. When these circumstances
    became known in Paris a strong party showed itself in the Assembly in
    favour of accepting the union of Avignon with or without the Pope’s
    assent. Mirabeau skilfully averted the danger of a flagrant breach of
    international law by securing the appointment of an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span> Avignon Committee,
    and when it became necessary to send regular troops to maintain order
    in the city, he secured their despatch thither without the assumption
    of any rights of sovereignty.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Affair of Nootka Sound. May 1790.</div>

  <p>Far more serious was the question which arose in May 1790, and which
    gave rise to the debate in the Constituent Assembly on the right
    of declaring peace and war, for it brought into prominence a doubt
    whether the Assembly should recognise the treaties made by the French
    monarchy. Of these treaties, the most popular in France, and the first
    to be brought into evidence, was the Pacte de Famille, which had
    been concluded in 1761 by Choiseul between France and Spain. Charles
    <span class="smcap">IV.</span> had succeeded his able and accomplished father, Charles
    <span class="smcap">III.</span>, on 12th December 1788. The new monarch was completely
    under the influence of his wife, Marie Louise, a princess of Parma,
    who in her turn was governed by a young guardsman, her lover, Godoy.
    Charles <span class="smcap">IV.</span> made a friend of Godoy, a fact which of itself
    shows the essential weakness of his character. He, as well as his
    Queen, was, outwardly at least, deeply religious, and it was pretty
    certain that before long a reaction would take place at the Spanish
    Court against the liberal <i>régime</i>, which, in the previous reign,
    under the administration of Aranda and Florida Blanca, Campomanes and
    Jovellanos, had done so much for Spain. But for the first three years
    of his reign, Charles <span class="smcap">IV.</span> maintained his father’s experienced
    ministers, with the assent of the Queen, who did not dare at once to
    introduce her lover into the ministry, or invest him openly with power.
    Florida Blanca, the Spanish minister, with Spanish pride, refused to
    recognise the actual weakness of Spain, and was particularly active in
    maintaining her supremacy in America. When, therefore, Vancouver Island
    was demonstrated to be an island and not a peninsula, he claimed its
    possession for Spain, and also alleged pre-colonisation. But he went
    further. Spanish officers had seized an English ship in Nootka Sound,
    now St. George’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span> Sound, in Vancouver Island, had destroyed an English
    settlement there, and had even insulted an English naval captain. When
    Pitt demanded reparation, Florida Blanca replied haughtily, and claimed
    the possession of the island on the grounds stated. Pitt at once sent
    one of the ablest English diplomatists, Alleyne Fitzherbert, afterwards
    Lord St. Helens, to threaten to declare war, and prepared a great
    fleet, known in English naval history as the Spanish Armament.</p>

  <p>Both Pitt and Florida Blanca knew that a war between England and Spain
    would only be seriously undertaken if France decided to intervene.
    Florida Blanca claimed the assistance of France under the terms of
    the Pacte de Famille, and Pitt, who understood that power had passed
    from Louis <span class="smcap">XVI.</span> to the Constituent Assembly, sent two secret
    emissaries to Paris to see if the Assembly was inclined to maintain
    the policy of the <i>ancien régime</i>. One of these emissaries was Hugh
    Elliot, brother of Sir Gilbert Elliot, afterwards Lord Minto, an old
    schoolfellow of Mirabeau, who was expected to influence the orator, and
    the other, William Augustus Miles, who was to ally himself with the
    leading democratic deputies. The question came before the Constituent
    Assembly on a letter from the Comte de Montmorin, Minister for Foreign
    Affairs. The enthusiasm in the Assembly for the maintenance of the
    Spanish Alliance was extreme, defiance was hurled at England, Spain’s
    faithful adherence to the Pacte de Famille in the Seven Years’ War and
    the War of American Independence was remembered, and a fleet for active
    service was ordered to be got ready at Brest, and sixteen new ships of
    war built. But the first burst of enthusiasm soon cooled. Some deputies
    feared war would strengthen the monarchy, others did not like to be
    bound by the treaties, especially the dynastic treaties of the <i>ancien
      régime</i>, and others again, headed by Robespierre and Pétion, inveighed
    against the idea of any offensive war. The whole question was referred
    to the Diplomatic Committee. Mirabeau, who knew perfectly well that
    Spain would not fight without the aid of France, read an able report,
    recommending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span> that the Pacte de Famille should be changed to a simple
    defensive treaty, which was adopted. The Court of Spain, seeing that no
    help was to be got from France under these circumstances, resigned its
    pretensions to Vancouver Island, and consented to pay the compensation
    demanded by England. This diplomatic victory of England exasperated
    the Spaniards; Charles <span class="smcap">IV.</span> was surprised and disgusted at the
    concessions made by Louis <span class="smcap">XVI.</span>, and declared them a breach of
    the Pacte de Famille; and by her conduct France lost the friendship of
    her closest ally of the eighteenth century.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Rights of the Princes of the Empire in Alsace.</div>

  <p>The third question in which the new state of things in France
    touched the diplomatic system of old Europe and threatened to cause
    international complications, which might lead to a foreign war, was
    concerned with the fiefs of the Empire in Alsace. By the Treaty of
    Westphalia that province had been ceded to France in full and entire
    sovereignty, but reserving the rights of the Empire. The complications
    caused by this ambiguous arrangement had raised perpetual difficulties
    throughout the reigns of Louis <span class="smcap">XIV.</span> and Louis <span class="smcap">XV.</span>,
    and many separate treaties had been concluded with individual princes,
    by which they recognised the sovereignty of France in Alsace, in return
    for the acknowledgment of all their ancient rights. A further problem
    was added by the fact that the more important princely landowners in
    Alsace were also ruling and independent sovereigns across the French
    border. They were thus supreme, save for the loose over-lordship of
    the Emperor in Germany, and subject to the French monarchy for their
    domains in Alsace. Among the principal of these rulers were the
    three ecclesiastical electors, the Archbishops of Mayence, Trèves,
    and Cologne, the Bishops of Strasbourg, Spires, Worms, and Basle,
    the Abbot of Murbach, the Dukes of Würtemburg and of Deux-Ponts or
    Zweibrücken, the Elector Palatine, the Margrave of Baden, the Landgrave
    of Hesse-Darmstadt, and the Princes of Nassau, Leiningen, Salm-Salm,
    and Hohenlohe-Bartenstein. These princes were naturally profoundly
    affected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span> by the abolition of feudalism decreed by the Constituent
    Assembly, which further complicated their position. They felt as German
    princes, and appealed against the measures of the Assembly as contrary
    to international law, and violating the Treaty of Westphalia and the
    many separate treaties. The protests of certain of these princes were
    laid before the Assembly on 11th February 1790, and referred by it to
    the Feudal Committee on 28th April. The reporter of the Committee on
    this matter was Merlin of Douai, one of the greatest French jurists
    and statesmen of the whole revolutionary period. On 28th October he
    read his report, in which he insisted on the new principle of the
    sovereignty of the people. He asserted that the unity of Alsace with
    France rested not on ancient treaties, but on the unanimous resolution
    of the Alsatian people to be Frenchmen. But at the same time he argued
    that in practice old rights ought to be maintained. Mirabeau, with his
    usual sagacity, saw that international complications might, on this
    ground, be adjourned, if not altogether avoided; and it was on his
    motion that the Constituent Assembly resolved to uphold the sovereignty
    of France in Alsace, and the application of all its decrees to that
    province, but at the same time requested the King to arrange the amount
    of indemnity to be paid to the Princes of the Empire as compensation
    for the rights of which they were thus deprived. These princes,
    however, with but very few exceptions, refused absolutely to accept any
    monetary compensation, and appealed to the Diet of the Empire. It was
    on this question, therefore, that foreign intervention most seriously
    threatened France at the end of 1790, in spite of the diplomatic
    knowledge and skill of two of her leading statesmen, Mirabeau and
    Merlin of Douai.</p>

  <p>While Mirabeau was doing his best to keep France from the disturbance,
    and even disasters, which a foreign war would cause in the midst of her
    new development, the Queen cast all her hopes for the restoration of
    the power of the French monarchy on the armed help of foreign states.
    Louis <span class="smcap">XVI.</span> in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span> a half-hearted fashion was opposed to foreign
    interference, but his younger brother, the Comte d’Artois, and the
    French <i>émigrés</i>, who had established themselves on the borders of
    France, declared that the King was not in his right senses, and that
    he was forced to yield to the measures of the Constituent Assembly
    against his will. They felt no patriotic misgivings, and loudly invoked
    the assistance of all monarchs in the cause of monarchy and the feudal
    system. The ruler on whom the Queen chiefly relied, and to whom she
    appealed most fervently, the monarch to whom the <i>émigrés</i> looked with
    most confidence, was Leopold, the brother and successor of Joseph
    <span class="smcap">II.</span> He held the key of the position; he was the sovereign
    especially feared by the leaders of the Constituent Assembly, and as
    Emperor and as brother of Marie Antoinette he was expected by the
    royalists to intervene in the affairs of France.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Emperor Leopold.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> successor of Joseph <span class="smcap">II.</span>, the Emperor Leopold, was, except
    perhaps Catherine of Russia, the ablest monarch of his time. He had had
    a long experience in the art of government, for he had succeeded to
    the sovereignty of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany in 1765, on the death of
    his father, the Emperor Francis of Lorraine. While his brother Joseph<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
    was kept until 1780 by Maria Theresa in leading-strings as far as the
    actual administration of the Hapsburg dominions was concerned, and
    was only able to exert his authority as Emperor, Leopold had from his
    boyhood been an absolute and irresponsible sovereign, and had imbibed
    from his education an Italian knowledge of statecraft. During his
    long reign in Tuscany he showed the finest qualities of a benevolent
    despot in his measures for increasing the material comforts of his
    people, combined with tact and diplomatic subtlety. His reforms were
    as sweeping as those of Joseph, but were so managed as not to set
    his dominions in a flame. With the help of Scipio de Ricci, Bishop
    of Pistoia, he freed the people of Tuscany from the heavy burden of
    an excessive number of ecclesiastics; he reorganised the internal
    administration, and especially the judicial system; and he showed such
    intelligence in grasping and partially applying the new principles of
    political economy as to be called ‘the physiocratic prince.’ He had
    been Grand Duke of Tuscany for twenty-five years, and when he succeeded
    his elder brother Joseph as King of Hungary and Bohemia in February
    1790, he had earned the reputation of a singularly wise and prudent
    statesman, and of one who, if it could be done, might be expected to
    restore the power of the House of Austria. He abandoned the Grand Duchy
    of Tuscany to his second son Ferdinand, and at once applied himself to
    the difficult task bequeathed to him by Joseph <span class="smcap">II.</span></p>

  <div class="sidenote">Policy of Leopold.</div>

  <p>Leopold found the power of Austria seriously affected by dangers from
    within and dangers from without. He at once undid much of Joseph’s
    work. He recognised the difference between consolidating and unifying a
    nation, which was essentially one, and a congeries of nations speaking
    different languages, belonging to different races, and geographically
    widely separated. In Tuscany he had accomplished a great work in
    abolishing the local franchises of the cities and building up a Tuscan
    state, but he understood that such a work was impossible in the divided
    hereditary dominions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span> of the House of Hapsburg, and that the Emperor
    Joseph had been attempting a hopeless task. Leopold’s first step was,
    therefore, to restore the former state of things in such parts of his
    dominions as were not in open insurrection. In Austria proper, in
    Bohemia, in the Milanese, and in the Tyrol, the concessions of Leopold
    were received with demonstrations of popular gratitude. He abolished
    the new system of taxation and the unpopular seminaries; he recognised
    the separate administrations of provinces which were essentially
    diverse; he gave up futile attempts at unification. But, at the same
    time, he maintained the edict of religious toleration, the most noble
    of Joseph’s reforms, and introduced many slight but appreciable
    improvements in the local institutions which he restored. Having thus
    assured the fidelity of an important body of his subjects, he prepared
    to deal with the declared rebels in Belgium and the unconcealed
    opposition in Hungary. It was here that Leopold suffered most from the
    foreign policy of Maria Theresa and Joseph, for it was indisputable
    that the prevalent discontent and insurrection in Belgium and Hungary
    was fostered by the Triple Alliance, and especially by Prussia. He
    had a serious war with the Turks on his hands; his ally, Catherine of
    Russia, was too much occupied with her wars with the Swedes and Turks
    and with the affairs of Poland, to come to his help; France, excited
    by her internal dissensions, and with the Assembly indisposed to the
    maintenance of the Treaty of 1756, might almost be reckoned an enemy;
    the Empire had been roused to distrust by the policy of Joseph, and the
    Triple Alliance was openly hostile. Under these circumstances Prussia
    appeared at once the chief power on the Continent and the principal
    enemy of Austria, and it was with Prussia that Leopold first resolved
    to deal.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Policy of Prussia.</div>

  <p>The events of the year 1789 had greatly improved the position of
    Prussia on the Continent. The pretensions of Joseph to Bavaria had made
    Frederick William <span class="smcap">II.</span>, as it had made Frederick the Great,
    the real leader of the Princes of the Empire, and the Triple Alliance
    had done more to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span> improve and strengthen his position in Europe. The
    classic policy of Prussia was consistent opposition to Austria, and
    Hertzberg, the Prussian minister, in pursuance of this policy, had
    made use of all Joseph’s mistakes to lower the power of the House of
    Hapsburg. He felt it necessary, indeed, to disavow a treaty with the
    Turks, which the too zealous Prussian envoy had signed in January 1790,
    but he was eager to make use of the difficulties of Russia and Austria
    caused by the Turkish war to forward Prussia’s designs on Poland. His
    main aim was to obtain the cession of the important Polish cities of
    Thorn and Dantzic, which would give Prussia complete control of the
    great river Vistula. The ablest Prussian diplomatist, Lucchesini, was
    sent to Warsaw, and on 29th March 1790 he signed a treaty of friendship
    and union with the Poles, by which Poland was to cede Thorn and Dantzic
    to Prussia in return for the retrocession of part of Austrian Galicia,
    which had fallen to Austria at the first partition, while Prussia
    promised to guarantee the territory and constitution of Poland, and
    to send an army of 18,000 men to the help of the Poles if they were
    attacked.</p>

  <p>This treaty, shameless even in its epoch for its desertion of allies,
    breach of former engagements and absence of good faith, was highly
    approved by Frederick William <span class="smcap">II.</span> and Hertzberg. They would
    not have dared to conclude it but for the seeming weakness of Russia
    and Austria, the partners in the former partition. Russia was hampered
    by the Swedish and Turkish wars, and the discontent of the ceded
    provinces of Poland. Austria was in a still more desperate condition.
    With the Turkish war still unconcluded, with open insurrection in
    Belgium, and disaffection in Hungary, unpopular in the Empire, and
    deprived of the alliance of France by the unconcealed dislike of the
    Assembly to the Treaty of 1756, it seemed as if the House of Hapsburg
    must now give way entirely to the House of Hohenzollern. Of the active
    encouragement given to the Turks, the Belgians, the Hungarians, and
    the Princes of the Empire against Austria by Prussia, mention has been
    made.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span> Not less skilful was the conduct of the Prussian ambassador
    at Paris, Goltz, who intrigued with the more extreme leaders in the
    Assembly, and especially Pétion,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> against Austria, and in particular
    did all in his power to increase the growing unpopularity of Marie
    Antoinette and to insist that she was a traitor to France.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Policy of Leopold.</div>

  <p>Had a less able statesman than Leopold been the successor of Joseph,
    the schemes of Prussia might have been crowned with success. But he had
    not ruled in the native city of Machiavelli for a quarter of a century
    for nothing; and he set to work to checkmate the designs of Hertzberg
    and Frederick William <span class="smcap">II.</span> His wise measures of conciliation
    speedily rallied the heart of the hereditary dominions to him; and he
    determined to use diplomacy to establish his position in Europe before
    he dealt with Belgium and Hungary. He quickly perceived that Prussia’s
    real strength lay in the support of the Triple Alliance; her financial
    situation was such that she dared not undertake a serious war without
    the active countenance of England and Holland. He knew that it was
    worse than hopeless to rely upon France, and therefore at once applied
    to England. He protested that he did not share his brother’s attachment
    for Russia, or his schemes for the division of the Ottoman provinces;
    and he further hinted that he would abandon all attempt to reconquer
    Belgium and surrender it to France unless he received some assistance.
    Pitt felt the weight of these considerations; he did not care much
    about what happened to Poland, but he cared a great deal that the
    French should not occupy Belgium. When, therefore, the King of Prussia
    mobilised a powerful army in Silesia, and demanded through Hertzberg
    that Austria should on the one hand make an armistice with the Turks,
    and on the other restore Galicia to Poland, Leopold, trusting that
    he had broken the harmony of the Triple Alliance, made no elaborate
    warlike preparations, but demanded a conference.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span></p>
  <div class="sidenote">The Conference of Reichenbach. June 1790.</div>

  <p>The King of Hungary and Bohemia thoroughly understood the character of
    the Prussian king and the intrigues of his courtiers and ministers; he
    knew that Hertzberg was the real enemy of Austria, and that Frederick
    William was unstable and easily persuaded. He felt that his own
    strength lay in diplomacy, not war. On 26th June the two Austrian
    envoys, Reuss and Spielmann, arrived at the headquarters of the
    Prussian army in Silesia at Reichenbach, and demanded a conference.
    Rather to the disgust of the Prussians, their allies of the Triple
    Alliance insisted on being present, and a regular congress was held,
    at which Hertzberg and Lucchesini represented Prussia, Reuss and
    Spielmann, Austria, Ewart, England, Reden, Holland, and Jablonowski,
    the Poles. Even the Hungarian malcontents and the Belgian rebels,
    relying on the promises of Frederick William, ventured to send envoys.
    The conclusions of the congress justified Leopold’s diplomatic skill.
    When Hertzberg laid the Prussian demands in full before the assembled
    envoys, to his surprise Jablonowski declared that the Poles would
    never cede Thorn and Dantzic, while the representatives of England and
    Holland not only advocated the maintenance of the <i>status quo</i>, but
    refused the co-operation of their governments in Prussia’s schemes for
    aggrandisement. The policy of Hertzberg and Kaunitz, of perpetuating
    the rivalry of Prussia and Austria, had failed. Leopold was far too
    acute to leave these matters to ministers. He placed himself in direct
    communication with the King of Prussia and his personal favourites,
    Lucchesini and Bischofswerder; he argued that the interests of the
    two great German states both with regard to Poland and France were
    identical, and on 27th July 1790 the Convention of Reichenbach was
    signed, by which Austria promised at once to make an armistice with the
    Turks, and eventually to conclude peace with them under the mediation
    of the Triple Alliance, while, on the other hand, the powers of the
    Triple Alliance guaranteed the restoration of the Austrian authority<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
    in Belgium. It was more privately arranged that Prussia should withdraw
    from encouraging discontent in Hungary and Belgium, and support
    Leopold’s candidature for the Imperial throne. This great diplomatic
    victory did more than merely check the active enmity of Prussia; it
    established the ascendency of Leopold over the weak mind of Frederick
    William; and it eventually, in May 1791, brought about, not indeed his
    actual dismissal from office, but the removal of Hertzberg, the sworn
    foe of Austria, from the charge of the foreign policy of Prussia.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Leopold and the Turks.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">The Treaty of Sistova. 4th Aug. 1791.</div>

  <p>The first actual consequence of the Convention of Reichenbach was the
    conclusion of an armistice between Austria and the Turks. The war had
    never been looked on with favour by Leopold, who regarded Joseph’s
    infatuation for the grandiose schemes of Catherine of Russia as absurd,
    and the dismemberment of Turkey as impracticable, and at the present
    time undesirable. He had not attempted to press matters against the
    Turks, and had withdrawn many of his best troops under Loudon from the
    seat of war to Bohemia to strengthen his position at Reichenbach. The
    Prince of Coburg, who succeeded Loudon, aided by an earthquake, took
    Orsova, and laid siege to Giurgevo, but he was defeated in his camp
    after a severe battle on 8th July 1790. This defeat was only partially
    compensated by a victory won by Clerfayt, and by the capture of Zettin
    by General de Vins on 20th July. Under these circumstances Leopold was
    not sorry to conclude an armistice for nine months at Giurgevo on 19th
    September. Shortly afterwards a congress of plenipotentiaries from
    Austria, Turkey, and the mediating powers met, as had been arranged
    at Reichenbach, at Sistova. The negotiations lasted for many months;
    Leopold insisted on the cession by Turkey of Old Orsova and a district
    in Croatia, which would make the Danube and the Unna the boundary
    between Austria and Turkey; Prussia at first strongly protested against
    any cession to Austria; the congress even for a time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span> broke up; and it
    was not until Leopold adroitly got Lucchesini, the Prussian envoy, on
    his side, that the important Treaty of Sistova upon the terms desired
    by Leopold was concluded on 4th August 1791.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Leopold crowned Emperor. 9th Oct. 1790.</div>

  <p>By this treaty the hereditary dominions of the House of Hapsburg were
    relieved from the danger of foreign war; the next result which Leopold
    drew from the Convention of Reichenbach was the re-establishment
    of the Austrian ascendency in Germany. Assured of the support of
    Prussia, Leopold travelled to the Rhine. On 30th September 1790 he was
    unanimously elected King of the Romans; on 4th October he solemnly
    entered Frankfort, and on 9th October he was crowned Emperor. But it
    was not enough for him to be crowned Emperor; he had to destroy the bad
    effect of his brother Joseph’s attitude towards the Empire; he had to
    become the real as well as the nominal head and leader of the German
    princes, and to win back the advantages which Prussia had secured by
    forming the League of Princes. The opportunity was afforded to him by
    the disinclination of the German princes, who owned territories in
    Alsace, Lorraine, and Franche Comté, to accept the compensation offered
    to them by the French Constituent Assembly. Their protests took the
    shape of a clause in the ‘capitulation’ laid before him and accepted
    by him on his election as Emperor by which he promised to intervene on
    behalf of the Empire for the preservation of the rights, sanctioned
    by the Treaty of Westphalia, of the princes, whose interests were
    affected. Leopold thus seized this opportunity to pose as the head of
    the German Empire, and on 14th December 1790 he wrote a very strong
    letter to Louis <span class="smcap">XVI.</span>, in which he said: ‘The territories in
    question have not been transferred to the kingdom of France; they are
    subject to the supremacy of the Emperor and the Empire: no member
    of the Empire has the right to transfer that supremacy to a foreign
    nation. It follows, therefore, that the decrees of the Assembly are
    null and void so far as concerns the Empire and its members,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span> and that
    everything ought to be replaced on the ancient footing.’<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

  <div class="sidenote">Leopold and Hungary.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Leopold crowned King of Hungary. 15th Nov. 1790.</div>

  <p>After being crowned Emperor at Frankfort, Leopold returned to Vienna
    and proceeded to establish his power firmly in Hungary. The discontent
    aroused in the most backward part of his dominions by the Emperor
    Joseph’s measures had not been appeased by that monarch’s wholesale
    retractation, nor even by the return of the Crown of St. Stephen. The
    Hungarian nobles regarded Joseph’s retractation as a sign of weakness,
    and, encouraged by the intrigues of Prussia and the difficulties
    in which Leopold was involved by the war with the Turks, resolved
    to obtain more sweeping concessions. The example of France exerted
    an influence even in Hungary, and the following sentences from a
    memorial,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> presented to Leopold by the people of Pesth, might have
    been written by a Parisian popular society: ‘From the rights of nations
    and of man, and from that social compact whence States arose, it is
    incontestable that sovereignty originates from the people. This axiom
    our parent Nature has impressed on the hearts of all; it is one of
    those which a just prince (and such we trust Your Majesty will ever be)
    cannot dispute; it is one of those inalienable, imprescriptible rights
    which the people cannot forfeit by neglect or disuse. Our constitution
    places the sovereignty jointly in the king and people, in such a manner
    that the remedies necessary to be applied according to the ends of
    social life for the security of persons and property, are in the power
    of the people. We are sure, therefore, that at the meeting of the
    ensuing Diet, Your Majesty will not confine yourself to the objects
    mentioned in your rescript; but will also restore our freedom to us,
    in like manner as to the Belgians, who have conquered theirs with the
    sword. It would be an example big with danger to teach the world that a
    people can only protect or regain their liberties by the sword, and not
    by <span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>obedience.’ The Hungarian Diet, which Leopold had summoned for the
    ceremony of his coronation, and to which the people of Pesth alluded in
    this remarkable address, was largely attended. The Hungarian nobility
    regarded its convocation as a further sign of weakness, for none
    had been held since the accession of Maria Theresa, and prepared an
    inaugural act or compact, which would have reduced the kings of Hungary
    to a similar position to that occupied by the kings of Poland. Full of
    confidence in themselves they even went so far as to send envoys, as
    has been mentioned, to the Congress of Reichenbach. Leopold, however,
    had no intention of yielding to these demands; his only desire was to
    gain time until he had secured his position by diplomacy. Meanwhile
    he tried to stir up opposition in Hungary itself, by encouraging
    the other nationalities in the kingdom, such as the inhabitants of
    Croatia and the Banat. But when the Congress of Reichenbach was over,
    the armistice of Giurgevo concluded, and his coronation as Emperor
    performed, Leopold proceeded to deal with the Hungarians. He first
    ordered the army of 60,000 men, which he had concentrated in Bohemia
    to support his attitude against the Prussians, to Pesth, and then
    directed the Diet to remove to Presburg for his coronation as King
    of Hungary. He then declared that nothing would induce him to accept
    the proposed new constitution, or to consent to an infringement of
    the Edict of Toleration, and that he would only consent to the terms
    of the inaugural acts of his grandfather, Charles <span class="smcap">VI.</span>, and
    his mother, Maria Theresa. The Hungarian nobles, overcome by his
    firmness and the presence of his troops, yielded; the Emperor appointed
    his fourth son, the Archduke Leopold, to be Palatine of Hungary in
    the place of the late Prince Esterhazy; and it was from him that he
    received the Crown of St. Stephen on 15th November, on the terms he had
    stipulated.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Parties in Belgium.</div>

  <p>Having gained this victory by his firmness, Leopold proceeded to win
    popularity by a timely concession, and proposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span> a law, obliging every
    future king to be crowned within six months of his accession. This
    concession was received with the wildest enthusiasm, as it obviated
    the possibility of conduct resembling that of Joseph <span class="smcap">II.</span>;
    the Diet granted the Emperor a gift of 225,000 florins instead of the
    usual 100,000 florins; and the disaffected attitude of the nobility
    was changed for one of hearty admiration and gratitude. The bourgeois
    of Pesth and their declarations were disavowed; the echo of the
    French Revolution, which had been heard there, was quickly stifled;
    and the Hungarian nobility, well contented with Leopold, declined to
    encourage the popular aspirations. The difficulties which the Emperor
    Leopold encountered in Hungary were trifling to those which faced
    him in Belgium. But in this quarter time had worked for the House of
    Hapsburg, and when the Congress of Plenipotentiaries, arranged at
    the Congress of Reichenbach, met at the Hague in October 1790, the
    situation had entirely changed. The victory of the Belgian rebels
    in 1789 had been followed by internal dissensions, which appeared
    directly the new Constitution was proclaimed. The first difference was
    between the Van der Nootists, or Statists, as they termed themselves,
    and the Vonckists. The latter, inspired by the success of the French
    Revolution, advocated a thoroughly democratic constitution, and the
    organisation of a new elective system of local administration, to the
    great disgust of the Statists, who desired simply the restoration of
    the old order of things, but with the central government controlled
    by elected assembly instead of being in the hands of the House of
    Hapsburg. Curiously enough popular feeling ran in a direction very
    different from that followed in France. Influenced by the priests,
    the Belgian people, and more especially the mob of Brussels, were
    convinced that the Vonckists were atheists; the democrats were attacked
    in the streets, maltreated and imprisoned; the bourgeois National
    Guards refused to protect them; they were proscribed by Van der Noot
    and the party in power; and after many riots and disturbances Vonck<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
    fled to France in April 1790. These events greatly weakened the
    Belgian Republic, for the democratic party, which had been energetic
    in the revolution, numbered in its ranks many of the ablest and
    most enlightened men in the country. But even more serious was the
    result abroad, for the National Assembly of France and Lafayette were
    surprised and disgusted at the persecution of the democrats, and the
    sympathy of the French people was entirely alienated from the Belgian
    leaders. Still more striking in its effect was the conduct of the Van
    der Nootists towards the gallant officer, Van der Mersch, who had
    commanded the patriot troops in the invasion of October 1789. Not
    satisfied with superseding him by the Prussian general, Schönfeld,
    the Van der Nootists had him arrested on a charge of disorganising
    the Belgian army and imprisoned at Antwerp, to the great wrath of the
    people of Flanders, of which province Van der Mersch was a native. The
    conquering party was further divided. The nobility and clergy, headed
    by the Duc d’Aremberg, were jealous of the ascendency assumed by Van
    der Noot, and of the continued omnipotence of the Assembly at Brussels.
    Under these circumstances it was a significant fact that the Austrian
    troops in Luxembourg under the command of Marshal Bender were able with
    the help of the people themselves to occupy the province of Limburg.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Leopold reconquers Belgium.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">The Austrians at Liége.</div>

  <p>In October 1790 the Congress, which had been resolved on at
    Reichenbach, met at the Hague. The Austrian plenipotentiary was the
    Comte de Mercy-Argenteau, the most accomplished Austrian diplomatist
    and ambassador at Paris, and the representatives of England, Prussia,
    and Holland were Lord Auckland, Count Keller, and the Grand Pensionary
    Van der Spiegel. Leopold now reaped the advantages of his skilful
    diplomacy at Reichenbach. England and Holland understood that the new
    Emperor was a very different man from his predecessor, and Prussia
    dared not act without them. As he had promised, Leopold solemnly
    announced his intention to restore all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span> the charters, laws, and
    arrangements, which had existed in Belgium in the time of his mother,
    Maria Theresa, under the guarantee of the three powers, and further
    promised a general amnesty if his authority was recognised by 21st
    November. The Belgian States-General made no reply to Leopold, and
    the Emperor proceeded to concentrate 45,000 men under Bender in
    Luxembourg. Then the Belgian leaders applied to the Congress at the
    Hague for a prolongation of the armistice and the restoration of the
    state of government existing in the time of Charles <span class="smcap">VI.</span> and
    not in that of Maria Theresa. These demands were supported by the
    representatives of the Triple Alliance, but rejected by the Austrian
    ambassador. On 21st November the Belgian States-General elected the
    Archduke Charles, the third son of the Emperor, to be hereditary Grand
    Duke, but the time had gone by for compromises, and on the following
    day Bender entered Belgium. The experiences of a year of revolution
    made the Belgian people not unwilling to return under the sway of
    Austria; the cities surrendered without a blow, and on 2d December
    1790 Brussels capitulated. Van der Noot fled with his chief friends,
    and Belgium was won back by Leopold as easily as it had been lost by
    Joseph. On 8th December the Comte de Mercy-Argenteau assented to the
    restoration of the liberties recognised in the inaugural act of Charles
    <span class="smcap">VI.</span>, but Leopold disavowed his ambassador and insisted on the
    authority possessed by Maria Theresa at the close of her reign. Under
    these circumstances the mediating powers refused their guarantee, a
    refusal which rather gratified the Emperor than otherwise, as it freed
    him from the fear of foreign interference. Not only in Belgium itself,
    but in the neighbouring bishopric of Liége also, Leopold established
    Austrian ascendency. The princes of the Circle of the Empire, which
    adjoined, were dissatisfied with the conduct of Prussia and General
    Schlieffen, and appealed to the Emperor. He was only too glad to assert
    his authority; Schlieffen evacuated the territory; and on 13th<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span> January
    1791 it was occupied by an Austrian force, which re-established the
    Prince-bishop in all his former authority.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Russia and Sweden.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Treaty of Verela. Aug. 14th 1790.</div>

  <p>The entire reversal of Joseph’s policy by Leopold, the arrangements
    made at Reichenbach, and the friendly attitude of the new Emperor
    towards the powers forming the Triple Alliance, deprived Russia of her
    only ally at a time when the Empress had on her hands two exhausting
    wars with Sweden and Turkey. The former was the most serious. Gustavus
    <span class="smcap">III.</span>, freed from the dangers of a Danish invasion, and by
    his <i>coup d’état</i> from the formidable plots of his nobility, rejoined
    his army in Finland and prepared to carry on the war vigorously by
    land and sea. His army was too small to effect much in spite of his
    near approach to St. Petersburg, and his chief confidence was in his
    fleet. This fleet was soon blockaded in the Gulf of Vyborg by the
    Russian admiral, the Prince of Nassau-Siegen, one of the most famous
    soldiers of fortune of the century; an attempt it made to break out on
    24th June 1790 was repulsed, and the Russians even hoped to force it
    to capitulate. But, to their surprise, the Swedes broke the blockade
    on the 3d July, though with a loss of 5000 men, and on 9th July won a
    great naval victory in Svenska Sound, in which the Russians lost 30
    ships, 600 guns and 6000 men. But this victory led to no corresponding
    diplomatic result. Catherine, defeated though she was, made overtures
    in no humiliated spirit to the King of Sweden, and proposed to him
    that, instead of quarrelling with his neighbours, he should turn
    his attention to the state of affairs in France. The chivalrous and
    romantic king was not unwilling to listen to her suggestions; he had,
    during a visit to Paris, been much impressed by Marie Antoinette, and
    was full of pity at the situation of the royal family of France and
    of disgust at the progress of the Revolution. He felt, too, that the
    war with Russia was not popular among his people, and on 14th August
    1790 he signed a treaty of peace at Verela, by which the <i>status quo
      ante bellum</i> between Russia and Sweden was restored without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span> any
    compensation in money or territory being obtained by the victorious
    Swedes.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Capture of Ismail. 20th Dec. 1790.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Treaty of Jassy. 9th Jan. 1792.</div>

  <p>While resisting the Swedes, Catherine made her chief effort against
    the Turks. In this quarter the defection of Leopold and the Armistice
    of Giurgevo seriously compromised her position. The war had resolved
    itself into the siege of the strong city of Ismail, where the Turks
    defended themselves with the utmost tenacity. The Russian attacks
    were foiled again and again, and Potemkin resigned the conduct of the
    siege in despair. His place was taken by Suvórov, whose brilliant
    victory on the Rymnik in 1789 had marked him as the greatest Russian
    general of his time. His valour and constancy equalled those qualities
    in the Turks; and Ismail was stormed on 20th December 1790, after a
    scene of carnage which cost the lives of 10,000 Russians and 30,000
    Turks. In the following year the Russians pressed onwards towards
    Constantinople, and on 9th July 1791 the Russian General Repnin, under
    whom served Suvórov and Kutuzov, defeated the Grand Vizier at Matchin.
    But the Empress Catherine was not inclined to follow up these military
    advantages. The policy of Leopold had isolated her; the Treaty of
    Sistova had deprived her of an auxiliary army against the Turks; the
    state of affairs in Poland demanded her most serious attention; and she
    had to observe the action of Europe on the French Revolution and of the
    French Revolution on Europe, in the hope of deriving some advantage for
    Russia from the complications. She, therefore, signed a treaty of peace
    with the Turks at Jassy on 9th January 1792, by which Russia retained
    only Oczakoff and the coast-line between the mouths of the Bug and the
    Dniester. By making this peace, Catherine only deferred the prosecution
    of the schemes of Russia against the Ottoman Empire, and certain
    clauses with regard to the Danubian Principalities, affording a pretext
    for future wars, were skilfully included in the Treaty of Jassy.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span></p>

  <div class="sidenote">Position of Leopold.</div>

  <p>The success of the policy of the Emperor Leopold entirely altered
    the situation of the European states and their attitude towards each
    other. He was in 1791 not only master in his own dominions, but the
    recognised representative of the Empire, in fact as well as in name.
    He had broken down the combination against Austria and the solidarity
    of the Triple Alliance. England was far more favourably inclined to
    him than she had ever been to Joseph <span class="smcap">II.</span>; Frederick William
    <span class="smcap">II.</span> of Prussia was his ally not his enemy. He was, therefore,
    able in 1791 to turn his thoughts to the situation of France, and to
    see what advantages could be drawn from the position of affairs there
    for the benefit of Austria. The political effacement of France in
    foreign affairs was due to the assumption of all real authority by the
    Constituent Assembly, while leaving the responsibility to the King’s
    ministers, and Leopold did not doubt that the result of an entire
    victory of the popular party would be a recurrence to the classical
    policy of opposition to Austria and the rupture of the Treaty of 1756.
    It was to his interest to prevent this, and he had therefore political,
    as well as personal, ends to secure in endeavouring to restore the
    authority of the King of France. The capture of the Bastille and the
    transference of the royal family to Paris were great events in the
    history of France, but they only affected Leopold as weakening the
    authority of Louis <span class="smcap">XVI.</span> and Marie Antoinette, the faithful
    allies of Austria. The behaviour of the Constituent Assembly gave him
    pretexts for interfering in France, in spite of the diplomatic ability
    of Mirabeau, and he was earnestly besought by the French <i>émigrés</i>,
    or opponents of the new state of things in France, who had gone into
    voluntary exile with the King’s younger brother, the Comte d’Artois, at
    their head, to intervene on behalf of the French monarchy.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The state of France, 1791.</div>

  <p>The conduct of the Constituent Assembly in disorganising every branch
    of the executive in France had its natural effect by the commencement
    of 1791. The army, in spite of the effort of General Bouillé to restore
    discipline by making an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span> example of some Swiss mutineers at Nancy in
    1790, was rendered inefficient by the disaffection of the soldiers and
    the exaggerated royalism of most of the officers; the navy was in a
    still worse condition; the Civil Constitution of the Clergy had caused
    a schism, which disturbed the minds of men in all parts of France,
    and created an army of opponents to the work of the Assembly, who had
    peculiar influence over the rural communities; the issue of assignats
    on the security of the confiscated domains of the Church had inflated
    the currency, and, while giving an appearance of fictitious prosperity,
    had really given a feeling of insecurity to all trade and commerce;
    the old internal administrations of the provinces had been replaced
    by the new administrations of the departments, which were filled by
    inexperienced men, utterly unable to cope with the difficulties of
    a time of unrest and revolution. The practical disorganisation of
    the executive was meanwhile being consecrated by the measures of the
    Constituent Assembly, which, in the Constitution it was drawing up, in
    its fear of the power of the monarchy, so hampered the authority of the
    executive as to destroy the necessary foundations of good government.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Death of Mirabeau.</div>

  <p>In its ardour for the Rights of Man and the principle of election,
    the Constituent Assembly forgot the need for enforcing the authority
    of the law, and the necessity for providing a strong arm to carry it
    into effect. Mirabeau had clearly perceived that France was drifting
    into a state of anarchy. In his secret notes for the Court he insisted
    on the importance of restoring its proper power to the executive, and
    he advised the King to leave Paris and call the partisans of order to
    his side. Civil war, he contended, was preferable to anarchy, cloaked
    by fine words; it would openly divide France into the adherents of
    order and of disorder, and result in the maintenance of the popular
    rights sanctioned by the royal power. The King was to acknowledge the
    right of the people to legislate, and tax themselves through their
    representatives, but was to point out the importance of maintaining a
    strong government <span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>to secure the happiness of the governed. Against
    foreign war, however, Mirabeau strongly protested; foreign interference
    would rouse the spirit of national patriotism, and if the King was
    suspected of favouring the foreigners, it would result in the overthrow
    of the monarchy, and in a long struggle before the country could agree
    on a new form of government. However, on 2d April 1791, Mirabeau
    died, and France was deprived of its most sagacious, if not its only,
    statesman. In truth, Louis <span class="smcap">XVI.</span> and Marie Antoinette had
    no wish to take Mirabeau’s advice; the King regarded civil war as a
    horrible calamity, and to be shunned in every way and at any sacrifice;
    the Queen longed for the interference of her brother, the Emperor, and
    begged him to intervene to restore the royal authority. The King’s
    religious convictions were wounded by the Civil Constitution of the
    Clergy; the Queen was roused to wrath by the feeling that she was a
    prisoner, by daily insults in the press, and by the degradation of the
    power of the monarchy. On 18th April 1791 the royal prisoners were
    prevented by the Parisians from going to Saint-Cloud for Easter, and
    on 18th May the Emperor Leopold issued a circular to all crowned heads
    calling attention to the position of the King of France in his capital.
    On 20th May he had an interview with the Comte de Durfort, a secret
    emissary from the Tuileries, at Mantua, and charged him to tell the
    King and Queen of France that ‘he was going to concern himself with
    their affairs, not in words, but in acts.’</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Flight to Varennes. 21st June 1791.</div>

  <p>The action of the Parisian mob on 18th April caused Louis <span class="smcap">XVI.</span>
    and Marie Antoinette to resolve to escape secretly from Paris,
    since they were obviously prisoners and could not leave openly.
    They determined, contrary to the advice so often given by Mirabeau,
    and contrary also to the wishes of the Emperor and of his able
    representative at the Hague, the Comte de Mercy-Argenteau, who knew
    France better than any living diplomatist, to fly towards the frontier.
    Leopold, under the pretext of supporting his authority in Belgium
    and Luxembourg, and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span> of his allies, the Elector-Archbishop of
    Trèves and the Bishop of Liége, massed his troops upon the frontier in
    readiness to succour or assist, and Bouillé, who commanded at Metz,
    made preparations to have the part of his forces on which he could rely
    ready to receive the fugitive monarch. On 20th June 1791 the royal
    family left Paris by night, after the King had drawn up a declaration
    protesting against the whole of the measures of the Constituent
    Assembly, and disavowing them. The flight, from a combination of
    circumstances, ended in the royal family being stopped at Varennes,
    and being brought back to Paris in custody. It had the most momentous
    results upon the history of the French Revolution, which are sometimes
    disregarded in the recollection of the romantic circumstances attending
    it.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Results of the Flight to Varennes.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">The Massacre of 17th July in Paris.</div>

  <p>The primary result of the flight to Varennes was the sudden
    comprehension by France that Louis <span class="smcap">XVI.</span> was an unwilling
    collaborator in the work of reconstituting the French government
    on a new basis. Hitherto the people, and even the leaders of the
    Constituent Assembly, had believed in his acquiescence, if not in his
    hearty assistance. But the declaration, left behind on the occasion
    of his flight, proved the contrary. The statesmen of the Constituent
    Assembly, including the makers of the new Constitution, such as Le
    Chapelier and Thouret, and the triumvirate of Duport, Barnave, and
    Lameth, who, after Mirabeau’s death, were the undisputed leaders of
    the majority, saw they had gone too far, and that in their desire to
    weaken the royal authority, they had seriously weakened the executive,
    and had made the King’s position intolerable. They therefore threw the
    blame of the flight to Varennes on the subordinates in the scheme,
    ignored the King’s declaration, and acted on the supposition that he
    was misled by bad advisers. This attitude not being wholly approved
    by the Jacobin Club, which, through its affiliated clubs in the
    provinces, exercised the most powerful sway in the formation of public
    opinion, the believers in the royal authority seceded and formed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
    Constitutional Club, or Club of 1789, which temporarily weakened
    the power of the Jacobins in Paris. But this secession was entirely
    sanctioned by the bourgeois classes both in Paris and throughout
    France, who had the strongest interest in the maintenance of order, and
    who sent in numerous declarations of their adhesion to the cause of
    monarchy. Moreover, their chief representatives in arms, the National
    Guard of Paris, under the command of Lafayette, had soon an opportunity
    of giving practical proof of this loyal disposition. The Cordeliers
    Club, which was chiefly influenced by Danton, a lawyer of Paris, who
    had Mirabeau’s gift of seeing things as they really were, felt it
    impossible to hush things up. They understood the King’s declaration
    to mean a declaration of war against the new Constitution; his flight
    to Varennes they rightly interpreted to show that he was trusting to
    the intervention of foreign powers to re-establish him in his former
    position; and they resolved to draw up a petition for his dethronement.
    This petition was largely the work of Danton and of Brissot, a
    pamphleteer and journalist, who had been imprisoned in the Bastille,
    and had imbibed republican notions in America, and a large crowd
    assembled to sign it on the Champ de Mars. Lafayette determined to
    disperse this crowd, and the National Guard, under his command, fired
    on the people, killing several persons. This vigorous measure, which
    was intended to show the power of the party of order, was followed by
    vigorous steps against the party for dethronement.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Revision of the Constitution.</div>

  <p>The leaders of the Cordeliers were proscribed. Danton and Marat fled
    to England, and the party of order seemed triumphant. A revision of
    the Constitution was undertaken, and various reactionary clauses,
    specially directed against the press, the popular clubs or societies,
    and the rights of assembly and of petition, were inserted. But this
    new attitude of the Constituent Assembly had but a slight effect
    upon France, for the king’s flight had caused the people in general
    to believe that he was the enemy of their new-born<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span> liberties, and a
    traitor in league with foreign powers to overthrow them.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Effects of the Flight to Varennes.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Manifesto of Padua. 6th July 1791.</div>

  <p>The flight to Varennes proved to the people of France, as well as
    to the monarchs and statesmen of Europe, that Louis <span class="smcap">XVI.</span>
    was a prisoner in Paris, and an enemy to the new settlement of the
    government, as laid down by the Constitution in course of preparation.
    The Emperor Leopold, as brother of Marie Antoinette, as Holy Roman
    Emperor and supporter of dynastic legitimacy, as the leading monarch of
    Europe, decided to intervene. On 6th July 1791 he issued the Manifesto
    of Padua, in which he invited the sovereigns of Europe to join him in
    declaring the cause of the King of France to be their own, in exacting
    that he should be freed from all popular restraint, and in refusing
    to recognise any constitutional laws as legitimately established in
    France, except such as might be sanctioned by the King acting in
    perfect freedom. The English Government paid little or no attention to
    these requests of Leopold, but the Empress Catherine, and the Kings
    of Prussia, Spain, and Sweden, for different reasons and in different
    degrees, heartily accepted Leopold’s views, and armed intervention to
    carry them into effect was suggested. But Leopold had no desire for
    war. His policy since his accession had been distinctly in favour of
    peace. He was a diplomatist, not a soldier, and he desired to frighten
    France by threats, rather than to fight France for the liberty of Louis
    <span class="smcap">XVI.</span> and his family.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Declaration of Pilnitz, 27th Aug. 1791.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Completion of the Constitution.</div>

  <p>The sequel to the Manifesto of Padua was a conference at Pilnitz
    between the Emperor Leopold and King Frederick William <span class="smcap">II.</span>
    of Prussia, accompanied by their ministers, in August 1791. At this
    conference the King’s brothers, Monsieur, the Comte de Provence,
    afterwards Louis <span class="smcap">XVIII.</span>, who had escaped from France at the
    time of the flight to Varennes, and the Comte d’Artois, afterwards
    Charles <span class="smcap">X.</span>, who had fled in July 1789, at the epoch of the
    capture of the Bastille, were present. They had their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span> own aims to
    serve. They were disgusted at the weak conduct, as they termed it, of
    Louis <span class="smcap">XVI.</span> in yielding so far as he had done to the popular
    wishes; they desired to undo the whole effect of the Revolution and
    to restore the Bourbon monarchy in its ancient authority by the arms
    of the monarchs of Europe. But Leopold did not care about the French
    princes or the Bourbon monarchy. He cared rather for the safety of
    his sister, Marie Antoinette, and the maintenance through her of the
    Franco-Austrian alliance. In the Declaration of Pilnitz, which was
    signed by the Emperor and the King of Prussia on 27th August 1791, the
    two sovereigns declared that the situation of the King of France was an
    object of interest common to all European monarchs, and that they hoped
    other monarchs would use with them the most efficacious means to put
    the King of France in a position to lay in perfect liberty the bases
    of a monarchical government, suited alike to the rights of sovereigns
    and the happiness of the French nation. Provided that other powers
    would co-operate with them they were willing to act promptly, and
    had therefore placed their armies on foot. These threats exasperated
    but did not terrify the French people. Leopold had no intention of
    entering upon hostilities, and found a loophole by which to escape from
    declaring war in the acceptance by Louis <span class="smcap">XVI.</span> of the completed
    Constitution on 21st September 1791. He then solemnly withdrew his
    pretensions to interfere in the internal affairs of France.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Polish Constitution. 3d May 1791.</div>

  <p>While the first Constitution of France, sanctioning the representative
    principle and the rights of the people, was being slowly built up in
    the midst of troubles and intrigues in Paris, a not less remarkable
    constitution was promulgated in Poland, manifesting the same ideas.
    The partition of Poland in 1773 had proved to all patriotic Poles that
    their independence as a nation was in the utmost peril. A serious
    effort was therefore made to organise the country, and to place the
    government on a settled and logical basis. The army was made national
    instead of feudal;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span> an attempt was made to establish a national system
    of finance, and a scheme of national education was propounded and
    partly carried into effect. But these measures were but steps in the
    work of making Poland a nation, instead of a loose confederation of
    nobles; the final decision was taken in 1788, when the Polish Diet
    elected a Committee to draw up a new Constitution, raised the national
    army to 60,000 men, and decreed regular taxes in order to replenish
    the national treasury. This consciousness of nationality enabled
    Stanislas Poniatowski, King of Poland, to negotiate as an independent
    and powerful sovereign with Prussia in 1789, and to send his envoys to
    Reichenbach in 1790 to act with the envoys of the other powers. The
    leading member of the Polish Constitutional Committee was Kollontai, a
    most remarkable man, and a Catholic priest, who had done good service
    as Rector of the University of Cracow, which he reorganised, and
    who had been made Vice-Grand-Chancellor of the kingdom. He was the
    principal author of the Polish Constitution, which was accepted by the
    Diet of Warsaw on 3d May 1791. This Constitution was noteworthy in what
    it abolished and what it created. It abolished the elective monarchy,
    the source of so many evils and intrigues, and declared the throne of
    Poland hereditary in the House of Saxony in succession to Stanislas
    Poniatowski, and it also abolished the <i>liberum veto</i>, which had
    enabled one member of the Diet to thwart the wishes of the majority. It
    created a regular government, conferring the legislative power on the
    King, the Senate, and an elected Chamber, and the executive power on
    the King, aided by six ministers responsible to the Legislature. The
    cities were permitted to elect their judges and deputies to the Diet;
    but the plague-spot of serfdom was too delicate to touch, and the Diet
    only declared its willingness to sanction all arrangements made between
    a lord and his serfs for the benefit of the latter. In some respects
    this Constitution compares favourably with that of France drawn up at
    the same time; if it does not proclaim so firmly the liberty of man,
    it at any rate is free from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span> lamentable fear of the power of the
    executive, which vitiated the work of the French reformers. France
    feared its executive after a long course of despotic monarchy; Poland
    felt the need of a strong executive after a long history of anarchy.
    Both countries, trying to be free, were affected in different ways, and
    with very different results, by the intervention of foreign powers.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Legislative Assembly.</div>

  <p>The acceptance of the completed French Constitution was the signal
    for the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly. It was at once
    succeeded by the Legislative Assembly, elected under the provisions
    of the new Constitution. The new Assembly consisted, owing to a
    self-denying ordinance passed in May 1791, on the proposition of
    Robespierre, forbidding the election of deputies sitting in the
    Constituent Assembly to its successor, of none but untried men, who
    had no experience of politics. They were mostly young men who had
    learned to talk in their local popular societies, and who at once
    joined the mother of such societies, the Jacobin Club at Paris. They
    were forbidden by a clause in the Constitution of 1791 to interfere
    with constitutional questions, which could only be touched by a
    Convention summoned for the purpose, and so could only interfere in
    current politics and matters of administration. In such interference
    they were justified by the position of powerlessness into which the
    executive authority, the King and his ministers, were reduced by
    the Constitution. The two burning questions which first came before
    them were, the treatment of the clergy who had not taken the oath to
    observe the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, and of the <i>émigrés</i>.
    Both questions gave plenty of opportunity for the display of fervid
    revolutionary and patriotic eloquence, for the priests, who had not
    taken the oath, were undisguisedly stirring up opposition to the
    Revolution in the provinces, and the <i>émigrés</i> were forming an army
    on the French frontier. And the Legislative Assembly was in a greater
    degree than either its predecessor, the Constituent, or its successor,
    the Convention, liable to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span> be swayed by oratory. The deputies liked
    to listen to glowing words and patriotic sentiments, and were largely
    influenced by the speeches of three great orators, Vergniaud, Gensonné,
    and Guadet, who all came from Bordeaux, the capital of the department
    of the Gironde, and to whose supporters posterity has given the name of
    Girondins. But these orators were in their turn influenced by a Norman
    deputy, Brissot. This veteran pamphleteer was a sincere republican;
    he also, having long been a journalist, believed himself a master
    of foreign politics. He desired to bring about a war between France
    and Austria. He believed that such a war would either cause the King
    to throw in his lot heartily with the Revolution, or, what was more
    likely, would make him declare himself openly against it, and would
    thus enable the advanced democratic party to call him a traitor, and
    by rousing all France against him, pave the way for his overthrow and
    the establishment of a republic. The first step was taken to make Louis
    <span class="smcap">XVI.</span> appear the opponent of the Revolution by passing a decree
    against the priests, who had not taken the oath, which his conscience
    would not permit him to sign; the second by passing a decree against
    the <i>émigrés</i>, who were led by his own brothers, and an instruction
    that he should ask the Emperor and the German princes on the Rhine to
    prevent the <i>émigrés</i> from forming an army, and to expel them if they
    did so.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Approach of War between France and the Emperor.</div>

  <p>The question of the expediency of war with Austria was soon taken
    up in France, and not only the Legislative Assembly but the popular
    clubs busied themselves in discussing it. The Declaration of
    Pilnitz exasperated the whole nation, which resented dictation or
    interference in the internal affairs of France, and the warlike and
    menacing attitude of the army of <i>émigrés</i>, which had been formed by
    the Prince de Condé on the French frontier at Worms, increased the
    universal wrath. Louis <span class="smcap">XVI.</span>, whose ministers had been but
    feeble figure-heads during the Constituent Assembly, at this juncture
    appointed the Comte de Narbonne, a young man of distinguished ability,
    to be Minister for War. Narbonne<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span> grasped the situation. He saw the
    people wished for war, and he therefore declared that the King was as
    patriotic as his subjects, and was also ready for war if satisfaction
    were not given to France. Three large armies were formed and placed
    upon the frontiers under the command of Generals Rochambeau, Lückner,
    and Lafayette, of whom the two former were created Marshals of France.
    By this policy Narbonne took the wind out of the sails of Brissot and
    the Girondins; he hoped that if the Austrian war was successful the
    King would be sufficiently strengthened in popularity to regain his
    authority as head of the executive; while, if it failed, the nation
    in its extremity would turn to its legitimate sovereign and invest
    him with dictatorial power. The leaders of the democratic party in
    Paris, which had been scattered by Lafayette in July 1791, saw this
    equally clearly with Narbonne, and therefore opposed the war with all
    their might. The Jacobin Club had become their headquarters; most of
    the deputies who came up from the provinces joined the mother society
    in Paris, and it soon became more powerful than ever in creating
    public opinion. The effect of the secession and consequent formation
    of the Club of 1789 only made the Jacobins more frankly democratic,
    while the presence of many of its members in the Legislative Assembly
    strengthened the influence of the Jacobin Club. It was in the Jacobin
    Club during the debates on the war that the difference between what
    were to be the Girondin and the Mountain parties in the Convention
    first appeared. Brissot and the Girondin orators argued in favour of
    war; while Marat, Danton, and still more Robespierre, whose career in
    the Constituent Assembly had made him exceedingly popular, opposed it.
    The last-mentioned orator was indeed the chief opponent of the war; he
    saw through Narbonne’s schemes, and hinted that the projected war was
    merely a court intrigue to promote the power of the King. The political
    strife became personal, and Robespierre, Marat, and Danton became the
    sworn foes of Brissot and the Girondins.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span></p>

  <div class="sidenote">Causes of war between France and the Emperor.</div>

  <p>The main causes of the war were the questions of the rights of the
    Princes of the Empire in Alsace and of the <i>émigrés</i>. The defence of
    the former rights as rights of the Empire had been pressed upon Leopold
    at the time of his election as Emperor, and on 26th April 1791 the
    Prince of Thurn and Taxis, as Imperial Commissary, summoned the Diet
    to meet. It assembled, and after a long discussion a <i>conclusum</i> was
    arrived at, that the Empire maintained the Treaties of Westphalia and
    of the eighteenth century now violated by France, and requested the
    Emperor to take severe measures against the revolutionary propaganda.
    The Emperor Leopold, as sovereign of Austria, had withdrawn from the
    position he had taken up at Pilnitz, but as Emperor he was obliged
    to submit this <i>conclusum</i> of the Diet to the King of France, which
    he did in a strongly-worded despatch drawn up by the Chancellor
    Kaunitz, which was laid before the Legislative Assembly on 3d December
    1791. It was as Emperor also that Leopold defended the conduct of
    the border princes of the Empire, notably the Elector-Archbishops of
    Trèves, Cologne, and Mayence, and the Bishops of Spires and Worms, in
    sheltering French <i>émigrés</i>. On 29th November 1791 the Assembly had
    desired the King to write to the Emperor and to these border princes
    protesting against the enlistment of troops by the <i>émigrés</i>, and the
    Emperor’s answer defending the conduct of the princes concerned was
    read to the Assembly on 14th December. The replies of Leopold were
    referred to the Diplomatic Committee, and on its report, the Assembly
    resolved on 25th January 1792 that the Emperor should be requested to
    explain his attitude towards France and to promise to undertake nothing
    against her independence in forming her own constitution and settling
    her own mode of government before 1st March 1792, and that an evasive
    or unsatisfactory reply should be considered as annulling the Treaty of
    1756 and as an act of hostility. The answer to this demand, which was
    drafted by Kaunitz, was read to the Assembly on 1st March; it censured
    the course which was being taken by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span> France, stigmatised the Revolution
    and accused the Jacobins of fomenting anarchy, and its first results
    were the dismissal of Narbonne, the impeachment of De Lessart, the
    Foreign Minister, and the formation of a Girondin ministry.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Death of Leopold, 1st March 1792.</div>

  <p>In the position he had taken up the Emperor Leopold was generally
    supported. The Princes of the Empire, as was represented in their
    <i>conclusum</i> passed at the Diet, not only resented the interference
    of France with historic rights in Alsace and her dictation as to
    whom they should shelter, but were beginning to fear the contagion
    of the revolutionary conceptions of the rights of man and political
    liberty. Throughout the Rhine provinces the peasants had risen in
    partial rebellion against their lords; in all the great cities of
    western Germany the more enlightened bourgeois protested against
    their exclusion from political influence. This contagion, however,
    did not spread far in these early days. The Empress Catherine, the
    King of Prussia, and the King of Sweden, who chiefly urged Leopold to
    make a brave stand against the Legislative Assembly, were urged by
    other motives. Catherine wished to see Austria and Prussia embroiled
    with France so as to have her hands free to deal with the Poles, who
    seemed likely with their new Constitution to ward off destruction.
    Frederick William <span class="smcap">II.</span> was disgusted by the disrespect shown
    to the principle of monarchy by the Parisians’ treatment of Louis
    <span class="smcap">XVI.</span> Gustavus <span class="smcap">III.</span> had imbibed a knightly admiration
    for Marie Antoinette, and felt a personal desire to relieve her from
    her position of humiliation. Each monarch showed his inclination
    characteristically. Catherine received some French <i>émigrés</i>, who
    found their way to her distant court, with kindness, and dismissed
    the French ambassador; Gustavus hurried to Spa to consult with the
    French <i>émigrés</i>, and proposed an immediate expedition to carry off
    the French court; Frederick William signed an offensive and defensive
    alliance with the Emperor on 2d February 1792, which saved him the
    trouble of personal decision, and left to the Emperor the harassing
    business of arranging the details of the war and of so carrying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span> out
    the necessary diplomatic negotiations which preceded an open rupture,
    that the interference of the powers should seem justified. In the
    midst of his preparations the Emperor Leopold died suddenly on 1st
    March 1792, the very day on which his last manifesto was read to the
    Legislative Assembly. His death was an irreparable blow for Austria,
    for Germany, for France, and for Europe. In his short reign he had
    shown himself to be a monarch of extraordinary ability, possessing
    alike singular tact and great force of character. He was succeeded
    in the hereditary dominions of the House of Hapsburg by his eldest
    son Francis <span class="smcap">II.</span>, an inexperienced youth, quite unfitted to
    continue Leopold’s policy in the troublous times approaching.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Murder of Gustavus III. 29th March 1792.</div>

  <p>Europe had hardly recovered from the shock of the Emperor’s sudden
    death, when it was startled by the news of the murder of Gustavus
    <span class="smcap">III.</span> of Sweden, who was shot on his way from a masked ball
    at Stockholm by an officer named Ankarström, on 16th March 1792. He
    lingered till 29th March, when he died, and was succeeded on the throne
    of Sweden by his infant son, Gustavus <span class="smcap">IV.</span> Duke Charles of
    Sudermania was appointed Regent. He at once reversed the policy of the
    late king; he felt none of the sympathy so warmly expressed by Gustavus
    <span class="smcap">III.</span> for Marie Antoinette, and he distrusted the close
    alliance which had been entered into with Russia after the Treaty of
    Verela. His first measure was to place Sweden in a position of absolute
    neutrality, from which she never swerved during his tenure of power.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Policy of Dumouriez.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">War declared by France against Austria. 20th April 1792.</div>

  <p>Of the ministers who came into office in France in March 1792 through
    the influence of the Girondins in the Legislative Assembly, the most
    notable were Roland and Dumouriez. The former was a sincere republican,
    who was induced by his wife to take up an offensive attitude to the
    King, the latter an experienced soldier and diplomatist, who was well
    fitted for the ministry of foreign affairs. Dumouriez at once accepted
    war with Austria as inevitable, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span> directed all his efforts to
    isolate her. He was a sworn enemy of the Austrian alliance, entered
    into by the Treaty of 1756, and cemented by the marriage of Marie
    Antoinette, and his first step was to endeavour to detach Prussia. He
    was sanguine enough to believe in the possibility of doing this, but
    he did not understand the character of Frederick William <span class="smcap">II.</span>
    It was difficult to induce that monarch to make up his mind, but when
    he did make it up he was obstinate. The French party at his Court,
    headed by his uncle Prince Henry, and in his ministry, represented
    by Haugwitz, was very strong; but, on the other hand, he had been
    convinced by Leopold that the cause of Louis <span class="smcap">XVI.</span> was the
    cause of monarchy, and the German party at Berlin hinted that if he
    allowed Austria to pose as the defender of the rights of the Empire by
    herself, the policy of Frederick the Great to make Prussia the leader
    of Germany would be undone. Frederick William <span class="smcap">II.</span>, therefore,
    listened coldly to the overtures of Dumouriez, and made preparations
    to support his ally in the field. On 20th April 1792 the Legislative
    Assembly assented almost unanimously to the King’s proposition, as read
    by Dumouriez, to declare war against the King of Hungary and Bohemia,
    as Francis <span class="smcap">II.</span> was at this time styled, and the great war,
    which was to rage with but slight intermissions for twenty-three years,
    began.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Invasion of the Tuileries. 20th June 1792.</div>

  <p>The commencement of the first campaign of 1792 proved how thoroughly
    the French army had been disorganised and demoralised by the policy of
    the Constituent Assembly and the general course of the Revolution. An
    attempt was made to invade the Austrian Netherlands or Belgium on four
    lines; but one column was seized with panic and rushed back to Lille,
    murdering its general, Theobald Dillon. The other commanders found
    their soldiers filled with a spirit of distrust for their officers
    and hardly amenable to discipline, and it soon became obvious that
    France would have to stand on the defensive. This news profoundly
    moved the people of France and especially of Paris. The word treachery
    was freely used<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span> in connection with the Court, and it was asserted
    that the plan of campaign had been revealed to the Austrians by the
    Queen. This was true; Marie Antoinette had always looked to Austrian
    help to rescue her from her position, and Louis <span class="smcap">XVI.</span> had now
    entirely come round to her view. At this juncture he dismissed his
    Girondin ministers on their insisting upon his signing a decree, which
    had been passed by the Assembly ordering the deportation of priests
    who had not taken the oath, and even accepted the resignation of the
    ablest of them, Dumouriez, who had offered to form a new ministry. The
    populace of Paris was intensely excited by the failure of the attack
    on Belgium, the concentration of the Prussian army on the frontier,
    and the dismissal of the popular ministers, and a body of petitioners,
    after filing through the hall of the Assembly, burst into the Tuileries
    and for some hours filled the palace, insulting the King and Queen and
    forcing the former to put on a red cap of liberty. The invasion of the
    Tuileries marked the final breach between the King and the people.
    Louis <span class="smcap">XVI.</span> longed more ardently than ever for the arrival
    of the allied monarchs; and the Jacobin leaders, who perceived the
    impossibility that France should be successful in war with an unwilling
    king at her head, began to plot for his overthrow. His last chance
    was lost, when he rejected the proffered assistance of Lafayette, who
    returned from his army without leave and offered to bring the National
    Guard of Paris to his help.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Francis II. Emperor. 14th July 1792.</div>

  <p>The news of the invasion of the Tuileries by the mob on the 20th June
    further decided the allied monarchs to take immediate action. Francis
    <span class="smcap">II.</span>, who was crowned Emperor at Frankfort on 14th July 1792,
    was eager to come to his aunt’s help. The position of the allies was
    now reversed. Instead of Austria in the person of the experienced
    Emperor Leopold guiding Prussia, it was now Frederick William
    <span class="smcap">II.</span> of Prussia who directed the policy of the young Emperor
    Francis. It was arranged that the Prussians should invade Champagne,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
    supported by a <i>corps</i> of Austrians and <i>émigrés</i> on their left, and
    joined midway by a <i>corps</i> of Austrians from their right, while an
    Austrian army under Duke Albert of Saxe-Teschen was to march from the
    Netherlands and invest Lille. The central Prussian army was placed
    under the command of the Duke of Brunswick, who issued a proclamation,
    drafted by an <i>émigré</i>, M. de Limon, and filled with violent language
    by Count Fersen, threatening to hold Paris liable for the safety of the
    King, and vowing vengeance on the French people as rebels.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Insurrection of 10th Aug. 1792.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Suspension of Louis XVI. 10th Aug. 1792.</div>

  <p>Brunswick’s proclamation was the very thing to complete the
    exasperation of the French people. National patriotism rose to its
    height; the country had been declared in danger, and thousands of
    volunteers were arming and preparing to go to the front; the threats
    of the Prussians only increased the national spirit of resistance; and
    the universal feeling was one of defiance. But there was obviously no
    chance of success while the executive remained in its present hands.
    The King’s power of interfering with the preparations for resistance
    had to be stopped. This was clearly understood by the democratic
    leaders, who, ever since 20th June 1792, had been organising an armed
    rising. They waited till some volunteers from Marseilles entered the
    capital, singing the song that bears their name, and then they struck.
    The royal plans for the defence of the Tuileries were thwarted; a
    number of the most energetic democrats ousted the Council-General of
    the Commune of Paris, and formed an Insurrectionary Commune; and the
    men of the poorer districts of Paris, the Faubourgs Saint-Antoine
    and Saint-Marceau, headed by the Marseillais, advanced to attack the
    royal palace. Before the assault commenced, Louis <span class="smcap">XVI.</span>,
    accompanied by his family and his ministers, took refuge in the hall
    of the Legislative Assembly. The attack was gallantly resisted by the
    Swiss Guards, who garrisoned the palace, but the people were eventually
    successful and the Tuileries was taken. The Legislative Assembly at
    once declared the King suspended from his office,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span> and ordered him
    to be confined with his family in the Temple. It then elected a new
    ministry, consisting of three of the former Girondin ministers, Roland,
    Clavière, and Servan for the Interior, Finance, and War, and three new
    men, Danton, Monge, and Lebrun for Justice, the Marine, and Foreign
    Affairs. This ministry, with the help of an extraordinary Commission
    of Twenty-one, elected by the Legislative, and of the Commune of
    Paris, displayed the greatest energy. By means of domiciliary visits,
    those suspected of opposition to the insurrection of 10th August were
    seized and imprisoned; a camp was formed for the defence of Paris;
    men were everywhere raised and equipped and sent to the front; and
    commissioners were sent throughout France, and especially to the
    armies, to tell the tale of the insurrection and to secure the adhesion
    of the people. Danton was the heart and soul of the defence movement
    and of the ministry, and inspired confidence and patriotism into those
    who hesitated; the Commission of Twenty-one, whose mouthpiece was the
    great orator Vergniaud, aided him to the best of their power; the
    Legislative directed the convocation of the primary assemblies, without
    distinction of active and passive citizens, for the election of a
    National Convention; and the Commune of Paris took measures to prevent
    any attempt at a counter-revolution.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Desertion of Lafayette.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">The Massacres of September 1792.</div>

  <p>But no amount of energy and patriotism could in a moment make trained
    armies and enable France to repulse the most famous troops in Europe.
    Fortunately for France, in this crisis, her untrained soldiers behaved
    admirably. Lafayette, on the news of the insurrection of 10th August,
    arrested the commissioners sent to him by the Legislative Assembly,
    and endeavoured to induce his army to march to the aid of the King.
    But his men refused; the former commander of the National Guard of
    Paris deserted, and Dumouriez took command of his army. Lille made a
    gallant resistance to the Austrians, who had formed the siege, but the
    Prussians met with no such obstinate opposition. Longwy surrendered
    to them on 27th August, and Verdun on 2nd<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span> September, and they
    continued their march directly on Paris. Dumouriez fell back with
    his main army to defend the uplands,—they can hardly be called the
    mountains,—of the Argonne. He summoned to him the <i>corps d’armée</i> on
    the Belgian frontier under Arther Dillon, and a detachment from the
    Army of the Rhine under Kellermann, while he was also reinforced by
    some thousands of undisciplined, and therefore useless, volunteers,
    and by a fine division of old soldiers collected from the garrisons
    in the interior. In Paris the news of the Prussian advance caused a
    panic; it seemed impossible that Dumouriez’ hastily concentrated army
    could oppose an effective resistance; and even Danton and Vergniaud
    could hardly keep up the enthusiasm they had at first aroused. At this
    juncture the Parisian volunteers were half afraid to go to the front
    for fear that the numerous prisoners, arrested during the domiciliary
    visits, would break out and revenge themselves on the families of the
    volunteers. This feeling induced the horrible series of murders, known
    as the Massacres of September, in the prisons. The massacres began
    fortuitously, and there were not more than 200 murderers at work; but
    the crowd, including national guards, stood by and saw them committed
    without raising a hand to help the victims. All Paris was responsible
    for the murders; they could have been easily stopped; but no one
    wanted to check them: the feeling which allowed them was the popular
    feeling; neither Danton, nor Roland, nor the Commune of Paris, nor the
    Legislative Assembly cared to interfere; the massacres were the answer
    to the Prussian advance and the capture of Longwy, as the insurrection
    of 10th August was the reply to Brunswick’s manifesto.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Battle of Valmy. 20th Sept. 1792.</div>

  <p>On 20th September 1792 the main Prussian army, which had reached the
    Argonne, attacked the position occupied by Kellermann at Valmy, and
    was repulsed. The victory was not a great one; the battle was not very
    hotly contested; the losses on both sides were insignificant; but its
    results both military and political were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span> immense. The King of Prussia,
    who complained that the Austrians had not fulfilled their engagements,
    and that the whole burden was thrown on him, was easily persuaded by
    the Duke of Brunswick to order a retreat. The Duke of Brunswick was
    induced to give that advice from military considerations, in that his
    army was wasted by disease and harassed by the inclement weather,
    and from policy, because, like many Prussian officers, he considered
    it unnatural for Prussians and Austrians to fight side by side. The
    retiring army was not hotly pressed; Dumouriez still hoped to induce
    Prussia to quit the coalition against France, and pursued with more
    courtesy than vigour until the army of Brunswick was beyond the limits
    of French territory.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Meeting of the Convention. 20th Sep. 1792.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Parties in the Convention.</div>

  <p>On the day of the battle, or as it is with more correctness termed the
    cannonade, of Valmy, the National Convention met in Paris and assumed
    the direction of affairs. It contained all the most distinguished men
    who had sat in the two former assemblies on the Left, or democratic
    side, and its first act was to declare France a Republic. After
    this had been unanimously carried, dissensions at once arose, and a
    fundamental difference between two groups of deputies appeared, which
    threatened to end in the proscription of the one or the other. On
    the one side were the distinguished orators of the Gironde, who have
    given their name to the whole party, reinforced by the presence of
    several old members of the Constituent Assembly and of a few young and
    inexperienced men. This group was roughly divided into Buzotins and
    Brissotins, or followers of Buzot, a leading ex-Constituant, and of
    Brissot, the author of the war; but some of the greatest of them, like
    Vergniaud, refused to ally themselves with either leader. The chief
    meeting-place of the Buzotins, who included most of the younger men,
    was Madame Roland’s salon. On the other side, taking their name from
    the high benches on which they sat, were the deputies of the Mountain,
    including almost the whole of the representatives of Paris, and all
    the energetic republicans, who had brought about the insurrection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
    of 10th August. This group comprised Robespierre, Danton and Marat,
    Collot-d’Herbois and Billaud-Varenne, all deputies for Paris, and none
    of whom, except Robespierre, had ever sat in either of the former
    assemblies, with some leaders of the extreme party in the Legislative,
    Merlin of Thionville, Chabot and Basire. It was not long before open
    quarrels arose between the two groups. The Girondins accused the
    leaders of the Mountain of having in the Insurrectionary Commune
    fomented the massacres of September in the prisons, and abused them
    as sanguinary and ambitious anarchists. This accusation was formally
    indeed brought against Robespierre by Louvet, a Rolandist Girondin,
    in an elaborate attack delivered on 29th October; while at the same
    time the Mountain accused the Girondins of being federalists and
    desiring to destroy the essential unity of the Republic, an accusation
    which was used with deadly effect at a later date. Both groups,—they
    cannot be called parties, for they had no party ties and recognised no
    party obligations,—appealed to the great majority of the Convention,
    the deputies of the Centre, who sat in the Plain or Marsh. The
    representative of this vast majority was Barère, an ex-Constituant, who
    trimmed judiciously between the two opposing groups.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Capture of Mayence. 21st October 1792.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Battle of Jemmappes. 6th Nov. 1792.</div>

  <p>The Convention, which had been elected in days of deepest dejection, if
    not despair, when the Prussians were moving on Paris and the Austrians
    were besieging Lille, was soon raised by a succession of conquests to a
    state of patriotic exaltation, bordering on delirium. In the month of
    September, just after the battle of Valmy, General Montesquiou occupied
    Savoy, and General Anselme the county and city of Nice, territories
    belonging to the King of Sardinia, without striking a blow. This was
    followed by a more important series of successes. Though not as a
    body engaged in war with France, many princes of the Empire had sent
    contingents to the aid of the Prussians and Austrians. In reply, still
    without declaring war on the Empire, the French attacked the Rhenish
    princes. On 1st October General<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span> Custine, commanding a corps of the
    Army of the Rhine, took Spires, on October 4 Worms, and on October
    21 Mayence, one of the bulwarks of the Empire and the capital of the
    Elector-Archbishop. From Mayence Custine detached divisions in other
    directions, and held the wealthy city of Frankfort-on-the-Main to
    ransom. Not less startlingly rapid were the conquests of Dumouriez on
    the north-east frontier. After the retreat of the Prussians he turned
    north against the Austrians; he raised the siege of Lille, which had
    been heroically defended, and on 6th November he defeated the Austrians
    in a pitched battle at Jemmappes, near Mons. This victory laid Belgium
    open to him. He occupied the whole country, entered Brussels as a
    conqueror, and established his headquarters at Liége. The conquest of
    Belgium intoxicated the Convention; they believed their armies to be
    invincible; they regarded themselves as having a mission to carry the
    doctrines of the French Revolution as embodied in the Rights of Man
    and the Sovereignty of the People into all countries; they declared
    themselves on 19th November ready to wage war for all peoples upon all
    kings; and in disregard of all international obligations, they declared
    the Scheldt, which by treaty had been closed to commerce for years, a
    free river, because it had its source in a free country.</p>

  <p>The intoxication which followed this series of unparalleled successes
    blinded the Convention to the need of improving and disciplining their
    troops. The French republicans did not comprehend that the chief cause
    of the facile conquests of their armies was that they met with the
    sympathy of the conquered. Belgium, the Rhine provinces, Savoy, and
    Nice were all filled with revolutionary enthusiasm, and welcomed the
    French as liberators; they requested to be united to France, when
    primary assemblies were summoned by the French commissioners, and
    on 9th November Savoy and Nice, and on 13th December the Austrian
    Netherlands or Belgium, were declared a part of France. In spite of
    these military<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span> successes, the republican army could not be organised
    in a day; the seeds of anarchy sown by the Constituent had gone too
    deep to enable discipline to be restored except by sharp measures; the
    administration of the army, that is, the commissariat, the war office,
    etc., was in a state of chaos; the soldiers, both officers and men,
    of all the armies, kept their eyes too closely fixed on the course of
    politics in Paris to do their duty efficiently at the front.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Execution of Louis XVI. 21st Jan. 1793.</div>

  <p>The burning question which divided the Convention at the end of 1792
    was the treatment to be meted out to Louis <span class="smcap">XVI.</span> Robespierre
    urged that, as a political measure, he should be put to death; but the
    Girondins, filled with an idea of imitating the English republicans
    of the seventeenth century, decided on a royal trial. When the trial,
    which was but a defence of Louis <span class="smcap">XVI.</span> by his counsel, was
    over, the Girondins, in their desire to avoid responsibility, or
    perhaps from a genuine belief that it might save the King’s life,
    proposed that the sentence on him should be submitted to the primary
    assemblies of the people. The deputies of the Mountain feared no
    responsibility, and taunted the Girondins with being concealed
    royalists. The motion for an appeal to the people was rejected; the
    King was sentenced to death by a small majority; and on 21st January
    1793 Louis <span class="smcap">XVI.</span> was guillotined at Paris.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">War with Spain, Holland, England, and the Empire.</div>

  <p>The result of the execution of Louis <span class="smcap">XVI.</span> was to give a
    pretext to the countries of Europe which had not yet declared war
    against the French Republic to do so. Charles <span class="smcap">IV.</span> of Spain,
    in the hope of saving the chief of the Bourbon family, maintained his
    minister at Paris until the last possible moment, and it was with
    reluctance that he placed his army in the field on the news of the
    King’s execution. The French Republic accepted the challenge, and early
    in March declared war against Spain. The war with Holland stood on a
    different basis. Dumouriez, after his conquest of Belgium, looked on
    Holland as an easy and particularly wealthy prey. He believed that by
    conquering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span> Holland, France would have in her hands a means of forcing
    England to keep the peace. His views were supported by Danton, who
    was sent on mission to Dumouriez’ headquarters. The contrary was the
    result. Pitt sincerely wished for peace, and was essentially a peace
    minister, but he had no idea of allowing the faithful ally of England,
    Holland, to be overrun and held to ransom by the French. The opening
    of the Scheldt had crowned the long series of French breaches of
    international law, and Pitt resented the assumption of the Convention
    that the law of nature, as interpreted by themselves, was to take
    the place of the law of nations. Pitt’s hand was also forced in two
    directions; the philippics of Burke had roused the fears of English
    property-holders against the spread of French principles; and George
    <span class="smcap">III.</span> was as anxious as any Continental monarch to preserve the
    dignity of kings. Pitt and his foreign minister, Grenville, gradually
    became convinced that the French meant to fight England, and that war
    was inevitable, and Chauvelin, the French ambassador, was ordered to
    leave London. The French leaders were under a misconception with regard
    to the spread of their ideas in England; they knew that a large body of
    educated men sympathised with them, and expected a national democratic
    rising which should overthrow not only Pitt, but the English monarchy.
    They did not understand that an English parliamentary opposition, in
    spite of its words, is as staunchly loyal as the ministry, and that it
    would never foment or encourage insurrection. Under these circumstances
    and deluded by these misconceptions France declared war against England
    and Holland on 1st February 1793. Many smaller nations entered on
    the fray. Sweden under the prudent government of the Regent Duke of
    Sudermania, Denmark under Christian <span class="smcap">VII.</span> and Bernstorff,
    and Switzerland declared their neutrality. But Portugal, where the
    heir-apparent, afterwards King John <span class="smcap">VI.</span>, had become regent
    for his mother, Maria Francisca, who was insane; Tuscany, whose Grand
    Duke, Ferdinand, was a brother of the Emperor; Naples, or rather the
    Two Sicilies,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span> whose king was a Bourbon, and whose queen was a sister
    of Marie Antoinette, all declared war on the French Republic. Catherine
    of Russia wore mourning for Louis <span class="smcap">XVI.</span> inveighed against the
    wickedness of the French republicans, and proceeded to take advantage
    of the occupation of the rest of Europe in the affairs of France to
    prosecute her schemes on Poland. Last of all, the Holy Roman Empire,
    which had decreed the armament of the contingents of the circles, on
    23d November 1792, after the news of the capture of Mayence, solemnly,
    and with all the circumlocution inseparable from the movement of the
    unwieldy machine, declared war against France on 22d March 1793.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Catherine invades Poland.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Second partition of Poland. 24th Sept. 1793.</div>

  <p>While regenerated France was at bay with nearly the whole of Europe,
    regenerated Poland was being conquered by a single power. While Europe
    pretended to fight France on behalf of the principle of monarchy,
    Catherine invaded Poland, because by the Constitution of 3d May 1791
    it had strengthened its monarchy. France was attacked because it was
    asserted to be in a state of anarchy, Poland because it had by wise
    reforms tried to put an end to an historic system of constitutional
    anarchy. As soon as Catherine had made peace with the Turks at Jassy,
    and Austria and Prussia were engaged in war with France, she intervened
    to overthrow the new Polish Constitution. It was not difficult to find
    Polish nobles who resented the abrogation of the old system, and,
    under Catherine’s encouragement, Branicki, Felix Potocki, and some
    others formed the Confederation of Targovitsa, and protested against
    the abolition of the <i>liberum veto</i> and the reforms of 3d May 1791.
    They then asked Catherine to send a Russian army to their assistance.
    She willingly complied, and on 18th May 1792 published a manifesto,
    stating that she was the guarantor of the ancient Polish Constitution,
    and stigmatising the reformers of 1791 as Jacobins. Suvórov at once
    entered Poland at the head of 80,000 Russians and 20,000 Cossacks, and
    by force of numbers defeated the Polish army under Joseph<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span> Poniatowski
    at Zielencé on 18th June 1792, and under Kosciuszko at Dubienka on 17th
    July. These defeats caused the reformers of 1791, including Kollontai
    and Kosciuszko, to go into exile; their place at the Diet was taken by
    the leaders of the Confederation of Targovitsa, and the Constitution
    of 3d May 1791 was abrogated. The conquest of the Polish patriots by
    Russia greatly excited the King of Prussia and the Emperor, and was one
    of the causes which induced Frederick William to order Brunswick to
    retreat after his trifling check at Valmy. The Polish patriots appealed
    to Prussia for help under the terms of the alliance of 1790, but the
    King only answered that he had not recognised the Constitution of 3d
    May 1791, and that the Polish leaders were Jacobins and imitators and
    allies of the French revolutionary leaders. A Prussian army, therefore,
    entered Poland to co-operate with the Russians and to share the spoil.
    A treaty of partition was signed by Catherine and Frederick William
    on 4th January 1793, by which Russia was to annex eastern Poland,
    including the whole of Minsk, Podolia, Volhynia, and Little Russia, and
    Prussia was to have Posen, Gnezen, Kalisch, and the cities of Dantzic
    and Thorn. Austria was too hotly engaged in the war with France to
    be able to claim a share, but the conduct of Prussia at this time in
    excluding her from the partition of Poland was never forgotten nor
    forgiven, and increased the hereditary feeling of distrust between
    the two powers. The Emperor Francis regarded himself as duped, and
    Prussia by acting alone broke the solemn engagements entered into with
    Leopold, and commenced the policy which was to end in the conclusion
    of the Treaty of Basle with the French Republic. Though the second
    partition of Poland was agreed upon in 1792, it was not consummated
    until the following year. A Diet was called at Grodno, and there, in
    the presence of the Russian soldiers, Stanislas Poniatowski and the
    Diet consented in silence, on 24th September 1793, to the arrangements
    made between Russia and Prussia. On 16th October Catherine signed a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
    treaty, guaranteeing the liberty of Poland, that is, the abuses of the
    old Constitution, which were certain to give Russia the opportunity
    of finishing the work of blotting out the Poles as an independent
    nationality from the map of Europe.</p>

  <p>The close of the year 1792 thus witnessed at the same time the
    overthrow of Poland and France in arms against foreign aggression.
    Each country was to make a violent effort for independence. The French
    were to be successful, because under the influence of personal and
    political freedom every Frenchman felt it his duty to resist foreign
    interference; Poland was to fail, because it was not the Polish people,
    but only the enlightened Polish nobles and bourgeois, who appreciated
    the situation.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">France at War with Europe.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> first months of 1793 found France at war with Europe. Though
    such minor states as Denmark and Sweden and Venice declared their
    neutrality, they manifested no desire to assist the French Republic,
    and their neutrality was but of slight service. It was otherwise <span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>with
    the neutrality of Switzerland. The Swiss cantons had nearly been drawn
    into the general war by the support given to the revolutionary party
    in the Republic of Geneva by the French ministry, which included among
    its members Clavière, a Genevese exile. The canton of Berne went so
    far as to occupy the city of Geneva, and it was only by the exercise
    of much diplomatic skill that open war was avoided. The neutrality of
    Switzerland made the land blockade of the French Republic of no avail.
    Through secret agents in Switzerland, arms, provisions, and necessaries
    were obtained from Southern Germany, and diplomatic relations were
    maintained with the democrats residing in the states of the belligerent
    powers. The declaration of war by the Holy Roman Empire completed the
    armed opposition of the greater countries of Europe against France.
    Of these countries Russia alone sent no army or fleet against the
    Republic, and Catherine satisfied herself with stating that she was
    engaged in conquering Jacobins in Poland.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Altered character of the War.</div>

  <p>The character of the war in 1793 differed from that waged in 1792.
    In 1792 France was invaded on behalf of Louis <span class="smcap">XVI.</span>, and
    the fighting was carried on according to the principles which had
    existed in the eighteenth century. But in 1793 the powers were at
    war with France for a different and more far-reaching reason. The
    revolutionary propaganda, that is, the idea consecrated in the decree
    of the Convention on the 19th of November 1792, that France was to
    spread among all countries the new doctrines of liberty, equality, and
    fraternity, vitally affected every government in Europe. England in
    particular, which had studiously kept aloof while the Revolution was
    pursuing its course at home, only felt obliged to interfere when the
    new rulers of France announced their intention of disregarding all
    principles of international law, and of converting other nations to
    their doctrines. It was this common opposition to the revolutionary
    propaganda which united the powers of Europe against France in 1793.
    England made herself the paymaster<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span> of the coalition. She lavished
    money freely, not only in subsidies to Prussia and Austria, but to less
    important countries, such as Spain and Sardinia. With this community
    of aim necessarily came a community of action. The war against France
    became a matter of principle and not of intrigue. This new attitude
    was marked by changes of ministry both in Prussia and in Austria.
    The failure of the invasion of 1792 disgusted Frederick William
    <span class="smcap">II.</span> with his advisers. The Duke of Brunswick fell into open
    disgrace, and Schulemburg, the foreign minister, made way for Haugwitz.
    At Vienna, Count Philip Cobenzl, the Vice-Chancellor of State, who had
    managed foreign affairs owing to the old age of Kaunitz, was dismissed,
    and his place was taken by Thugut, a man of low origin, whose sole
    political object was the humiliation of France, and his guiding
    principle a horror of French principles. Even in the secondary states
    similar ministerial changes took place, of which the most remarkable
    was the dismissal of Aranda in Spain, who was succeeded in power by
    Godoy, the Queen’s lover.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">First Campaign of 1793.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Battle of Neerwinden. 21st March 1793.</div>

  <p>The first result of the formation of the coalition was a determined
    attack upon Dumouriez’ position in Belgium. That general had hitherto
    not despaired of detaching Prussia from Austria, but the execution of
    Louis <span class="smcap">XVI.</span> destroyed his last hope. Both Prussia and England
    declined to listen to his lavish promises; his army had wasted away
    while in winter quarters; the first volunteers returned to their homes
    in thousands when France was freed from the invaders; the troops he
    retained were deprived of all necessaries by the disorganisation
    of the French War Office; and the people of Belgium, finding that
    their country was annexed to the French Republic, in spite of their
    patriotic desire for independence, showed their hostility in every
    way, and harassed instead of aiding the French troops. Under these
    circumstances, Dumouriez’ invasion of Holland failed, as it was certain
    to fail. His right wing, which was besieging Maestricht under the
    command of General Miranda, was defeated by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span> Austrians under the
    command of the Prince of Coburg, and he had to withdraw his advanced
    divisions, for fear of being cut off from France. He was rapidly
    pursued. An English army, under the Duke of York, joined the Austrians,
    under the Prince of Coburg, and Dumouriez was utterly defeated by
    the allies at Neerwinden on the 21st March 1793. The defeat became a
    rout, and the French were driven from Belgium as speedily as they had
    conquered it. Dumouriez then made a fruitless effort to lead his army
    against the Convention. He arrested four deputies and the Minister for
    War who had been sent to suspend him from his command, but, finding
    that his army would not follow him, he deserted to the Austrians on the
    5th April.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Committee of Public Safety.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Insurrection in La Vendée. 1793.</div>

  <p>The effect of Dumouriez’ reverses, and, finally, of his desertion,
    on the temper of the Convention was most striking. The enthusiasts
    who believed in the inauguration of a new era, who boasted that free
    Frenchmen, even without arms and discipline, would be able to defeat
    all foreign armies, and who considered that the career of the Republic
    was certain to be one of victory, were rudely awakened. The need of
    the creation of a strong government was forced upon the attention of
    the Convention. Danton, recurring to the views of Mirabeau, proposed
    that a new ministry should be chosen from among the members of the
    Legislature. But the republicans had the same horror of the power
    of the executive as the constitutionalists, and Danton’s motion was
    rejected. Nevertheless, it was quite impossible that an unwieldy
    assembly and a discredited ministry could defend France with any
    degree of success. As early as January 1793, a Committee of General
    Defence had been elected by the principal committees of the Convention;
    this was replaced, on the news of the defeat at Neerwinden, by a
    Committee of General Defence of twenty-five members chosen directly
    by the Convention; this was still too unwieldy, and on the news of
    the desertion of Dumouriez, the first Committee of Public Safety of
    nine members,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span> exercising supreme executive authority, was appointed.
    But the question was, how was the Committee to be enabled to rule.
    Its first duty was to raise soldiers to meet the enemies upon every
    frontier. For this purpose eighty-two deputies of the Convention were
    sent through France, two and two, to raise by volunteering where
    possible, but by conscription if other measures failed, 300,000 men.
    This call for recruits caused disturbances in many parts of France;
    in La Vendée it started civil war. It was to protest against the
    conscription, and not to defend the Church or the nobility, that
    the people of La Vendée rose in insurrection. But the leadership
    of the movement, which had at first been taken by gamekeepers and
    postillions, was speedily assumed by members of the ancient French
    clergy and nobility. Cohesion was thus given to the insurgents, and a
    large and important district in the west of France maintained for a
    time a successful opposition to the decrees of the Convention. But the
    reverses and desertion of Dumouriez not only caused, for the first time
    in the history of the Revolution, the creation of a real executive,
    it caused also the forging of the weapons by which that executive
    was in the future to establish the Reign of Terror. On 9th March the
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Paris was established. Its special object was
    the summary punishment of all enemies of the Revolution. On the 4th of
    April the Convention decreed that a maximum price of food should be
    fixed. Extended powers were granted to deputies sent on mission to the
    armies or to the departments; and an army, consisting of the very poor,
    or <i>sans culottes</i>, was proposed.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Overthrow of the Girondins. 2d June 1793.</div>

  <p>While these measures, which did not take full effect for some months,
    were being debated, the Convention was torn by the opposition between
    the Girondins and the deputies of the Mountain. The details of the
    struggle are not important. The arguments used by the Girondins were
    that their enemies were responsible for the massacres of September in
    the prisons, that they were under the influence of the Commune<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span> of
    Paris, and that they encouraged anarchy. The Mountain, on their side,
    alleged that the Girondins were concealed royalists, because they had
    voted against the execution of Louis <span class="smcap">XVI.</span>, that they were
    federalists, who desired to destroy the unity of the Republic, and that
    they preferred a weak to a strong government. The struggle was mainly
    carried on in the tribune of the Convention; Robespierre attacked
    Brissot, Vergniaud, and Guadet, and these orators replied by attacking
    Robespierre and Danton. The latter for a time endeavoured to avoid
    breaking with the Girondins, but he was so violently impeached for his
    conduct while on mission in Belgium, and accused of being an accomplice
    of Dumouriez, that in self-defence he was forced to take up the
    gauntlet. He had been elected to the first Committee of Public Safety,
    and though his constitutional indolence prevented him from becoming its
    most important member, he shared with Cambon, the financier, the chief
    responsibility of the new method of government. Meanwhile, worse news
    kept coming from every frontier. It was felt to be both injudicious and
    unpatriotic for the Convention to be occupied in personal squabbles
    when the fate of France was in the balance. The Commune of Paris
    decided to intervene. The deputies who sat in the Plain, or Centre of
    the Convention, were more influenced by the eloquence of the Girondins
    than by the energy of the Mountain, and it was with regret that they
    felt obliged to yield to the Commune of Paris. On the 31st May 1793,
    regular troops and national guards, under the direction of Hanriot, the
    commander of the National Guard of Paris, surrounded the Tuileries,
    to which the Convention had removed on the 10th May, and the Commune
    demanded that the leading Girondins should be expelled from the
    Convention, and sent for trial before the Revolutionary Tribunal. The
    <i>coup d’état</i> was completed on the 2d June, when these demands were
    complied with, and from that date the Girondins as a political party in
    the Convention ceased to exist.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span></p>

  <div class="sidenote">Second Campaign of 1793.</div>

  <p>The desertion of Dumouriez left the way clear for the Austrians and
    English to invade France. They advanced slowly and did not attempt,
    like the Duke of Brunswick in the previous year, to mask the frontier
    fortresses and move straight upon Paris. On 24th May the French camp at
    Famars was stormed; on 12th July Condé, on 28th July Valenciennes, were
    taken after making an obstinate resistance, and the allies were thus
    firmly established in France. Then, fortunately for the Convention,
    the allied commanders-in-chief quarrelled. The Duke of York, acting
    under the orders of the English ministry, besieged Dunkirk, which port
    he desired to hold for the disembarkation of supplies. The Prince of
    Coburg, with the Austrians, refused to assist in the siege of Dunkirk,
    and invested Le Quesnoy. Further south the Prussians captured Mayence
    on the 22d of July, and a mixed army of Austrians and troops of the
    Empire under Würmser forced their way into Alsace. At both ends of
    the Pyrenees Spanish armies invaded the French Republic. In the
    eastern Pyrenees nearly the whole of Roussillon was conquered, and in
    the western Pyrenees the passage of the Bidassoa was forced. These
    repeated reverses in so many quarters did not destroy the courage of
    the Convention or of the French people, but they proved that hastily
    raised undisciplined masses can never be a match for trained soldiers.
    The successes of Dumouriez and Custine had been as much the result of
    accident and of the hearty reception given to them by the natives of
    the districts they invaded as of talent and bravery, but the first
    defeats showed how thoroughly the policy of the Constituent Assembly
    had sapped the discipline of the French army.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Civil war in France.</div>

  <p>To add to the dangers which threatened France during the summer of
    1793, civil war in many quarters redoubled the perils caused by the
    foreign invasion. The war in La Vendée increased in magnitude almost
    daily, and the soldiers of the Republic were frequently defeated by
    the hardy peasants who fought in guerilla fashion among their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span> woods
    and marshes. Throughout Brittany and in the mountains of Auvergne
    similar movements took place, generally guided by priests and country
    gentlemen; but except in La Vendée there was no serious royalist
    manifestation. But the expulsion of the Girondins from the Convention
    had given rise to another movement of even greater importance. The
    insurrections in La Vendée and similar risings in country or mountain
    districts were the work of ignorant peasants; the movement in favour of
    the Girondins was headed by wealthy and intelligent cities. The news of
    the <i>coup d’état</i> of the 2d of June was received with consternation in
    most of the chief cities of France. Girondin journals had long preached
    the wickedness of the Commune of Paris, and that the leaders of the
    Mountain were either anarchists or ambitious men aiming at power.
    These words now had their effect. Several of the deputies proscribed
    on the 2d of June escaped into the provinces, and a group of them,
    collected at Caen in Normandy, endeavoured to organise an army against
    the Convention. Other cities followed the example. Marseilles arrested
    the representatives on mission; Bordeaux refused to receive the
    deputies sent to it; Lyons started a counter-revolution and executed
    Chalier, the leader of the local democratic party; and several cities
    agreed to send detachments of local troops to form a central army
    against the Convention at Bourges. For a few days matters looked most
    threatening for the victorious members of the Mountain, but they were
    well served by the deputies on mission. The Norman army was easily
    defeated at Pacy on the 13th of July; Bordeaux and Marseilles quickly
    submitted, and Lyons was invested. But the success of the Mountain was
    due to something more than the vigour of its representatives in the
    provinces. The general sentiment in France was that the conduct of
    the Girondins in causing civil war showed the very excess of want of
    patriotism; even if the Commune of Paris had done wrong in interfering
    with the Convention, the Girondins had behaved worse in attempting
    to rouse the provinces, and owing to this sentiment many departments
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>and many cities speedily repented of the encouragement they had given
    to the Girondin designs, and withdrew their support to the proposed
    concentration of local troops at Bourges.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Constitution of 1793.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">The work of the first Committee of Public Safety.</div>

  <p>The deputies of the Mountain met the unparalleled dangers of foreign
    and civil war with undaunted courage. Their first measure was to
    draw up with extreme rapidity a republican constitution, which is
    known as the Constitution of 1793. As it never came into effect, the
    details of this proposed system of government need not be described.
    But the fact that it was drawn up, promulgated, and sent before the
    primary assemblies of the people, deprived the Girondin insurgents
    of one of their chief weapons. They had asserted that the Mountain
    admired anarchy and wished to retain power for the Convention and
    themselves. To these allegations the issue of the Constitution of
    1793 was an adequate reply. But it was quite impossible, according to
    the leaders of the Mountain, for the Convention to abandon the reins
    of power. A general election at such a time would but increase the
    difficulty of the situation. So, while declaring the existence of the
    new Constitution, it deferred putting it into effect, and strengthened
    the authority of its new executive, the Committee of Public Safety.
    The advantages to be derived from the concentration of authority in
    a few hands became quite clear to the Convention after the expulsion
    of the Girondins. It may be doubted whether the distinguished orators
    who directed Girondin opinion, from their constant apprehension of
    the dangers of a strong executive to individual liberty, would ever
    have perceived them. The existence of the Committee made it possible
    for representatives on mission and other agents of government to
    have a central authority on which to rely. It was the Committee
    which directed the short campaign in Normandy which overthrew the
    most promising movement of the escaped Girondin deputies; it was the
    prudence of a member of the Committee, Robert Lindet, which pacified
    Normandy, after the victory had been won, by ruthlessly tracking down
    the ringleaders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span> and generously sparing those who had been led away;
    it was the Committee which first attempted to re-establish discipline
    in the armies and to supply them with provisions and munitions of war;
    and it was on the motion of the most important member of the first
    Committee, Danton, that the fatal decree of the 19th of November, which
    consecrated the revolutionary propaganda, and gave good reason for the
    continued opposition of foreign powers, was repealed. This good work
    in all directions showed the members of the Convention that they were
    acting in the right direction.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Great Committee of Public Safety.</div>

  <p>On 10th July 1793 the first Committee was dissolved on the motion of
    Camille Desmoulins, but a new Committee with similar powers was at
    once elected. This Committee, which may be called the Great Committee
    of Public Safety, remained in power for more than a year. Danton was
    not a member of it, partly because he believed he could do better work
    outside, partly because of his dislike of continued labour; Cambon also
    was not re-elected, preferring to confine himself to the charge of
    the finances of the Republic as the principal member of the Financial
    Committee. The nine members originally elected in July were Barère, who
    acted as reporter throughout its tenure of office, and was therefore in
    some respects the most important of them all; Jean Bon Saint-André, who
    took charge of naval matters; Prieur of the Marne and Robert Lindet,
    whose main duties were to provide for the feeding of the armies;
    Hérault de Séchelles, the chief author of the Constitution of 1793, who
    busied himself with foreign affairs; Couthon, Saint-Just, Gasparin, and
    Thuriot. Robespierre entered the Committee in the place of Gasparin on
    the 27th of July; Carnot and Prieur of the Côte-d’Or were added on the
    14th of August to superintend the military operations on the frontiers;
    Billaud-Varenne and Collot-d’Herbois were added on September the 6th
    to establish the Reign of Terror; and on the 20th of September Thuriot
    retired. The steps in the growth of the supremacy of this second
    Committee of Public Safety are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span> significant. On the 1st of August 1793
    Barère read his first report to the Convention. In it he proposed the
    most energetic, not to say sanguinary, measures. The war was to be
    carried on with the utmost energy; La Vendée was to be destroyed; and
    Marie Antoinette was to be sent for trial before the Revolutionary
    Tribunal. On the same day Danton proposed that the Committee should be
    formally recognised as a provisional government, and that the ministers
    should be directed to act as its subordinates. This motion was not
    carried, but the entire control over the resources of France, and the
    lives of Frenchmen, which Danton contemplated, was secured without the
    passing of a formal decree. The Convention seems to have been very
    glad to rid itself of the work of government. It accepted without a
    murmur every measure proposed by the Committee of Public Safety; it
    re-elected the members month after month; it threw all responsibility
    upon them and registered all the decrees they proposed. As has been
    said, it definitely gave them the charge of the military operations by
    the election of Carnot and Prieur of the Côte-d’Or, and it established
    the unity of their internal administration by the election of
    Billaud-Varenne and Collot-d’Herbois.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Position of Robespierre.</div>

  <p>The rule of the second or Great Committee of Public Safety is generally
    known as the Reign of Terror. The Committee itself divided the chief
    functions of government among its members. The special functions of
    all, except those of Robespierre, Couthon, and Saint-Just, have been
    already noticed. Robespierre was the only one amongst them who had any
    reputation outside, or indeed within, the walls of the Convention.
    His conduct during the session of the Constituent Assembly, his
    clear-sighted opposition to the war with Austria, his sagacious
    views on the subject of the treatment of the King, his war against
    the Girondin federalists, his oratorical talent, and above all his
    reputation for being absolutely incorruptible and sincerely patriotic,
    made him the man of mark among the Committee. He was well aware of the
    importance of his position. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span> colleagues on the Committee used him
    as their figure-head to represent them on great occasions, and he made
    it his business to lay down the general principles which underlay the
    system of revolutionary government—that is, of the Reign of Terror. But
    though to the Convention and to France at large Robespierre was the
    most conspicuous member of the Committee of Public Safety, he really
    exercised but very slight influence on the actual work of government.
    He had no department of the State given into his charge; he had not
    the necessary fluency or facility to take Barère’s place as ordinary
    reporter; he was not on terms of friendship with the majority of his
    fellow-workers; he was made use of, but was neither trusted nor liked
    by the real governors of France. It was to their benefit that the
    system of the solidarity of the Committee was established, which gave
    to all their measures the sanction of Robespierre’s great reputation
    for incorruptibility and patriotism. The majority of the Committee
    had no positive views on government; they tried to do the work which
    lay to their hands in the best way they could; Robespierre alone
    hoped to evolve out of the Reign of Terror a new system of republican
    government. His only real friends in the Committee were the two men
    least suited to give him effectual help, for Couthon was a cripple,
    and unable to attend with the necessary assiduity, and Saint-Just was
    but five-and-twenty, the youngest of the Committee, and was generally
    absent from Paris on special missions.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Reign of Terror.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Committee of General Security.</div>

  <p>The system by which the Great Committee of Public Safety regulated the
    Reign of Terror was based upon two important institutions. The first of
    these was the Committee of General Security which sat in Paris, and was
    elected from the members of the Convention, and which exercised general
    police control over all France. On great occasions its members sat with
    the Committee of Public Safety as a Committee of Government, but its
    special functions were to deal with men, while the Committee of Public
    Safety dealt with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span> measures. Danton, who was the principal creator of
    the supremacy of the Great Committee of Public Safety—though he himself
    refused to join it—saw the importance of subordinating in fact, if not
    in name, the Committee of General Security to the Committee of Public
    Safety. On 11th September 1793 a Committee of General Security had been
    elected, containing certain deputies of independent character, and
    Danton, fearing a rivalry would arise between the two Committees, at
    once obtained its dissolution, and secured, on September the 14th, the
    election of a Committee of General Security which would act in harmony
    with the great Committee. The members elected at this time were with
    but few exceptions re-elected every month.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Deputies on Mission.</div>

  <p>The second instrument by which the Great Committee ruled were the
    deputies on mission. The practice of sending deputies on special
    missions originated in August 1792. It had grown in importance, and
    the deputies proved their value in their vigorous suppression of the
    Girondin movement in the provinces in the summer of 1793. The power
    of deputies on mission was more than once specifically declared to be
    unlimited. On grounds of public safety they were not only permitted,
    but were ordered, to alter the composition of local authorities,
    whether municipal or departmental. They had full powers to arrest
    and to make requisitions. They were consistently supported by the
    Committee of Public Safety sitting in Paris, and the greatest latitude
    was given to them in administering the local government. As long as
    they preserved the peace and sent up plenty of supplies of money, and,
    when demanded, of recruits to Paris, their methods of government were
    not minutely inquired into. Besides the deputies on mission employed
    in the internal administration, another important body of similar
    representatives were kept at the headquarters of the different armies.
    These deputies likewise had unlimited authority. They could arrest even
    generals-in-chief at their absolute will; they could degrade officers
    of any rank; they could interfere with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span> military operations; and could
    overrule the orders of a general in the field. The Committee of General
    Security and the deputies on mission ruled by means of inspiring
    terror. This terror was based on the existence of the Revolutionary
    Tribunal in Paris, and of its imitations termed revolutionary or
    military commissions in the provinces, and the armies.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Law of the Suspects.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Law of the Maximum.</div>

  <p>The Revolutionary Tribunal took cognisance of all political offences,
    and its sentence was almost invariably death. Nearly every Frenchman
    or Frenchwoman could be brought within the net of the Revolutionary
    Tribunal by the Law of the Suspects. By this law, which was most
    carefully drafted by Merlin of Douai, any one who for any reason could
    be suspected of disliking the new state of affairs could be arrested.
    All relatives of <i>émigrés</i> or of noblemen came into this category as
    well as all former functionaries and officials of whatever sort. But
    since the Law of the Suspects was not sufficiently wide to impress the
    ordinary bourgeois, more especially the petty bourgeois, with terror, a
    new weapon was forged in the Law of the Maximum. This law was put into
    operation in September 1793. The laws of political economy could not be
    seriously affected by such a measure as the Law of the Maximum, which
    fixed maximum prices at which all articles of prime necessity were
    to be sold. Such a law was certain to be evaded; but its existence,
    and the fact that evasions of the Law of the Maximum brought the
    offender under the Revolutionary Tribunal, was enough to establish the
    Reign of Terror over the petty bourgeois. There were other means for
    extending the system which need not here be particularised, such as
    the necessity of every person carrying a card with him giving a full
    history of his conduct during the Revolution, the encouragement of
    denunciations by the bestowal of rewards, and similar precautions. The
    Revolutionary Tribunal was provided with victims under these measures
    by the Committee of General Security, and by the numerous little
    Revolutionary Committees sitting in every section of Paris, and in
    every city, district, and village<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span> throughout France. The Revolutionary
    Committees consisted of tried Jacobins, and were in the provinces
    appointed by the deputies on mission. They were frequently purified by
    the expulsion of any member who gave evidence of moderate opinions. The
    Revolutionary Committees filled the prisons—it was the business of the
    Revolutionary Tribunal to empty them. This it did with much expedition.
    The death sentences of the Revolutionary Tribunal of Paris, which only
    averaged three a week from April to September 1793, averaged thirty-two
    a week from September 1793 to June 1794, and 196 a week in June and
    July 1794. This increase was very gradual; it became an established
    system to send batches of victims to the guillotine every day; and the
    numbers in these batches increased steadily. The Committee of Public
    Safety, through its agent, the Committee of General Security, did not
    much care who were executed as long as a considerable number went to
    the scaffold every day. Exceptions to this rule are, however, to be
    noted in the executions of Marie Antoinette on 16th October 1793, of
    twenty-one Girondins on 31st October, of certain generals, such as
    Custine, Houchard, and Biron, and of the Duke of Orleans and Bailly,
    which intimidated courtiers, deputies, generals, and ex-Constituants.</p>

  <p>This system of terror was not suddenly evolved—it was the result of
    gradual growth. The two men mainly responsible for systematising it and
    carrying it into effect were Billaud-Varenne and Collot-d’Herbois, who
    were specially added to the Committee of Public Safety to superintend
    the internal administration of France. On 10th October 1793, on the
    motion of Saint-Just, the Constitution of 1793 was declared suspended,
    and revolutionary government, that is, the Reign of Terror, was ordered
    to continue until a general peace. On 10th December Billaud-Varenne
    read a report which defined the system, of which the most important
    clause was the substitution of national agents nominated by the
    government,—that is, by the deputies on mission,—to take the place of
    the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span> elected procureurs-syndics of the districts. The Reign of Terror
    in the provinces varied greatly. Some proconsuls, such as Carrier at
    Nantes and Le Bon at Arras, carried out their government in the most
    bloodthirsty fashion, but the ‘Noyades,’ or drowning of prisoners
    wholesale at Nantes, must not be regarded as typical of the terror
    in the provinces. Many proconsuls, such as André Dumont, contented
    themselves with threats, and while filling their prisons with suspects
    declined to empty them by means of the guillotine. Other proconsuls,
    such as Bernard of Saintes, preferred to send an occasional batch of
    prisoners to Paris to having a revolutionary tribunal of their own;
    but in every case except those of Carrier and Javogues, which were
    too atrocious to be passed over, the Committee of Public Safety gave
    its agents in the provinces a free hand to rule as they would so long
    as they maintained internal tranquillity and passive obedience to the
    decrees of the revolutionary government.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Results of the Terror.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Battles of Hondschoten and Wattignies. 1793.</div>

  <p>While the government of the Committee of Public Safety was being
    organised in Paris and in the provinces, disasters succeeded each other
    with rapidity both on the frontiers and in the interior of France. The
    Prussians, after the capture of Mayence, only advanced a short distance
    into France; but the Austrians made steady progress in the north-east
    in conjunction with the English, and, under Würmser, penetrated Alsace
    and stormed the lines of Wissembourg. The Comte d’Artois declared his
    intention to place himself at the head of the insurgents in La Vendée,
    at Lyons, and in the mountains of Auvergne. The English also promised
    to send armed assistance in every direction. But the younger brother
    of Louis <span class="smcap">XVI.</span> thought it enough to make promises—he did
    absolutely nothing to fulfil them. The English on their part confined
    themselves to one important operation. They had on the outbreak of
    war despatched a fleet to the Mediterranean under the command of Lord
    Hood, and on the 4th of August 1793 the insurgents at Toulon, in the
    course of their opposition to the Convention, surrendered their city to
    the allied English and Spanish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span> fleets. In Lyons the same progress of
    opposition was to be observed. The original insurgents had professed
    federalist opinions, but when the Convention sent an army against
    them open royalists took the place of the federalists. The vigorous
    action of the new government soon freed the French Republic from
    its foreign and internal foes. Carnot, on taking charge of military
    measures, saw that the only means of defeating the invaders was to
    take advantage of the numbers of his soldiers and to act in masses.
    Acting on this policy General Houchard raised the siege of Dunkirk
    and defeated the English and Hanoverians in the battle of Hondschoten
    (8th September). In spite of his victory Houchard was disgraced for
    not following it up with vigour. Jourdan, his successor, carrying out
    the same policy, concentrated his army against the Austrians, raised
    the siege of Maubeuge, and defeated the Austrians at Wattignies (16th
    October). These victories did not drive the Anglo-Austrian army out
    of France, but they stopped the progress of the allies and caused
    them to stand upon the defensive. Farther south the same vigour was
    displayed. Saint-Just restored discipline in the armies of the Rhine
    and the Moselle. Hoche, at the head of the latter, won the victory
    of the Geisberg (25th September) over the Austrians and Prussians,
    while Pichegru, at the head of the Army of the Rhine, relieved
    Landau and drove Würmser across the Rhine. Almost at the same time a
    powerful army, of which the best regiments were the former garrison of
    Valenciennes, captured Lyons on the 9th of October, and on the 18th of
    December Toulon was retaken by an army under the command of General
    Dugommier. It was at the siege of Toulon that Napoleon Bonaparte first
    made himself conspicuous and won the rank of general of brigade. The
    republican armies were equally successful against the Spaniards. The
    Army of the Eastern Pyrenees, under D’Aoust, recovered Roussillon,
    while that of the Western Pyrenees, under Müller, drove the Spaniards
    across the Bidassoa. In La Vendée equal success was achieved. The
    former garrison of Mayence, which was composed of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span> excellent soldiers
    who had gained experience and discipline from their long resistance
    to the Prussians, destroyed the Vendéan armies, and the insurrection
    of the province was severely punished by Carrier at Nantes and by
    the infernal columns which, under General Turreau, were directed to
    devastate the country. These repeated successes in every quarter
    reconciled the French people to the hideous <i>régime</i> of the Reign of
    Terror. Its despotism was excused because of its success, and its
    absolute authority reluctantly submitted to as a necessary evil.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Fall of the Hébertists and Dantonists.</div>

  <p>In Paris the supremacy of the Committee of Public Safety and the Reign
    of Terror met with opposition in two distinct quarters. On the one
    hand the Commune of Paris, which was principally influenced by the
    Procureur-Syndic, Chaumette, and his substitute, Hébert, soon began
    to resent the loss of its former authority. The Commune had actually
    carried out the <i>coup d’état</i> which overthrew the Girondins, and had
    expected to reap the chief advantage for itself. In order to form a
    party it demanded that the revolutionary government should cease and
    that the Constitution of 1793 should be put into force. But this cry
    did not raise a sufficiently powerful support. The leaders of the
    Commune, therefore, allied themselves with the most extreme democratic
    party, which met generally at the Cordeliers Club. This extreme party
    professed absolutely atheistic principles. It proclaimed the Worship
    of Reason; it celebrated that worship with orgies in the cathedral of
    Notre Dame; it induced Gobel, Bishop of Paris, to resign his see; it
    carried its opposition to Christianity to an extreme; and started a
    system of persecution against the Christian religion. In home politics
    it did not defend the socialistic notions which had found some currency
    in Paris, but it nevertheless declared itself the party of the <i>sans
      culottes</i>, and denounced all rich men and bourgeois as selfish egotists
    and enemies of the people. In foreign policy it adopted the doctrines
    of the revolutionary propaganda and declared it the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span> destiny of France
    to destroy all tyrants. The Committee of Public Safety, as soon as
    its power was firmly organised, resolved to overthrow this party of
    opposition by striking at its leaders. Robespierre attacked them in the
    Jacobin Club, and caused them to be excluded as atheists and enemies of
    all government; Danton denounced the Worship of Reason as a disgraceful
    masquerade; Camille Desmoulins exhausted his resources of eloquence
    and sarcasm to hold them and their doctrines up to reprobation in the
    <i>Vieux Cordelier</i>. As soon as the extreme party, which is commonly
    called the Hébertist party, after its most conspicuous leader Hébert,
    the editor of the <i>Père Duchesne</i>, was thoroughly discredited, the
    Committee of Public Safety struck. On 24th Ventôse (14th March 1794)
    Hébert and his principal supporters were arrested on the report of
    Saint-Just. They were at once sent for trial before the Revolutionary
    Tribunal, and on 4th Germinal (24th March) they were guillotined.</p>

  <p>The Hébertists fell because they opposed the despotism of the new
    government. The Dantonists, who followed them to the guillotine, fell
    because they believed the Reign of Terror to be carried too far. Danton
    had done more than any man to bring about the supremacy of the Great
    Committee of Public Safety. Convinced as he was that only a strong
    executive could possibly disentangle France from the dangers which
    beset her on every side, he had consistently advocated the creation
    of a strong government. Though not himself a member of the Great
    Committee, he had believed it to be his duty to support its power on
    every possible occasion. He had not only been the chief author of its
    supremacy, but the principal creator of the system by which it ruled.
    But he began to believe, in the beginning of the year 1794, that the
    Reign of Terror was being too stringently exercised. He was quite in
    accord with Billaud-Varenne and Collot-d’Herbois in considering it
    necessary to frighten the people of France into acquiescence with the
    new order of things, but he did not consider that it was necessary
    to shed so much blood to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span> accomplish the work of fright. His friend
    Camille Desmoulins had in the <i>Vieux Cordelier</i> not only exposed the
    Hébertists, but had hinted at the need for mercy and the advantages of
    appointing a Committee of Mercy. The Great Committee of Public Safety
    was not only determined to maintain its autocratic power, but to defend
    its system of government. Danton’s influence in the Convention was
    still sufficiently great to give the members of the Committee a cause
    for uneasiness. It therefore resolved, in order to stop all murmuring
    against the Reign of Terror, and to establish a reign of terror
    over the Convention itself, to make an example of the most vigorous
    patriot in France. On 10th Germinal (30th March 1794) Danton, Camille
    Desmoulins, and their chief adherents were arrested, and on 16th
    Germinal (5th April 1794) the Dantonists followed the Hébertists to the
    guillotine. These two blows ensured the supremacy of the Committee of
    Public Safety and the continuance of the Reign of Terror.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Campaign of 1794.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Battle of Fleurus. June 26, 1794.</div>

  <p>The Great Committee of Public Safety knew that its tenure of power
    rested on its successful conduct of the foreign war. Throughout
    the interior tranquillity prevailed except in La Vendée, where the
    sanguinary measures adopted perpetuated a guerilla warfare. The French
    troops were, in 1794, in a very different condition from that in which
    they had been left at the commencement of 1793. The measures of terror
    which pacified France had been in the army the cause of the restoration
    of discipline. Constant fighting had converted the men into efficient
    soldiers. Excellent officers had come to the front during the campaign,
    and, owing to the rapidity of promotion, most of the generals were
    young and energetic men. All that was best in France had gone to the
    front. There, and there alone, men who might have fallen under the
    terrible Law of the Suspects at home, were not only safe themselves,
    but by their presence in the ranks of the Republic protected their
    relatives. All the resources of France were laid at the disposal of her
    armies. The country became one vast arsenal. The soldiers were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span> well
    fed, clothed, and armed, and the ablest administrators were employed in
    rendering them efficient. The result of this concentration of France
    upon the foreign war was success in every quarter. In the spring of
    1794 the various armies took the offensive, the Army of the North,
    under Pichegru, marched by the northern line into Belgium, while a new
    army, afterwards called the Army of the Sambre-and-Meuse, which was
    formed out of the Army of the Ardennes, and a wing of the Army of the
    Moselle penetrated Belgium from the south. Before these two armies the
    English and Austrians fell back. They were rapidly pursued, and on the
    26th of June 1794 Jourdan won the battle of Fleurus. This victory, like
    the victory of Jemmappes the year before, laid Belgium open to the
    French armies. Brussels was reoccupied; the English and Dutch retired
    into Holland; the Austrians fell back behind the Meuse. Meanwhile, the
    Army of the Moselle, under René Moreaux, stormed the Prussian position
    at Kaiserslautern, and with the Army of the Rhine drove the Austrians
    across that river. The Army of Italy, which had taken Toulon, also took
    the offensive, and defeated the Piedmontese at Saorgio. Dugommier, with
    the Army of the Eastern Pyrenees, turned the tables on the Spaniards,
    and crossing the mountains penetrated into Catalonia, while the Army of
    the Western Pyrenees invaded Spain in that quarter, and threatened San
    Sebastian.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Battle of the 1st of June.</div>

  <p>The only checks which the Great Committee received were at sea. Whether
    it was because it is more difficult to improvise a navy than an army,
    or because sufficient attention was not paid to the republican navy, it
    is impossible to decide, but it is quite certain that the sailors of
    the Republic did not rival the soldiers in success, though they did in
    valour. One reason for this was that all the best sailors preferred the
    lucrative work of preying upon the commerce of the world in frigates
    and privateers to serving in the regular fleets, where no prizes were
    to be made. The two principal French fleets were those stationed at
    Toulon and at Brest. An ineffectual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span> effort had been made by Sir Sidney
    Smith to burn the Toulon fleet when the English and Spaniards evacuated
    that port. Nevertheless, a new fleet was soon prepared, but its action
    against the English and the Spaniards who blockaded the coast were
    ineffectual. The English on leaving Toulon had proceeded to Corsica.
    That island had been raised against the Convention by the native
    patriot, Paoli, who invited the English to come and take possession in
    the name of George <span class="smcap">III.</span> In Corsica, owing to the weakness of
    the French Mediterranean fleet, the English remained unmolested for
    nearly a year. The Brest fleet, however, came to blows with the English
    Channel fleet, under the command of Lord Howe. The United States of
    America had agreed to pay part of the debt which they owed France for
    money lent during the War of American Independence in grain, and a
    convoy was sent to protect the grain-ships. Lord Howe was directed to
    cut off this convoy, and the French fleet left Brest to ensure its
    safe arrival. From one point of view, the action of the French fleet
    was crowned with success, for the convoy arrived safely, but the fleet
    itself was utterly defeated by Lord Howe on the 1st of June 1794. Since
    the object had been attained, the Committee of Public Safety claimed
    credit for the action in which the fleet had been engaged, and the
    reports which Barère read daily from the tribune of the Convention were
    invariably of battles won and of feats of valour.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Fall of Robespierre, 9th Thermidor (27th July) 1794.</div>

  <p>The brilliant successes which followed the establishment of the power
    of the Great Committee of Public Safety justified its despotism in the
    eyes of France, but as soon as those successes had freed France from
    the invaders, it was generally felt that the weight of the Reign of
    Terror was intolerable, and that it had become unnecessary. It was at
    this period of most brilliant military triumphs that the Terror grew
    to its greatest height in Paris. On 22d Prairial (10th of June 1794)
    a law was passed to accelerate the procedure of the Revolutionary
    Tribunal,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span> and the number of deaths upon the guillotine increased to
    an average of 196 a week. Robespierre, who, as has been said, was
    more of a statesman than his colleagues upon the Committee of Public
    Safety, who were simply administrators, understood the tenor of feeling
    in France. He believed that the time was coming when the Reign of
    Terror should cease, and a new Reign of Virtue, carrying into effect
    the maxims of Rousseau, could be established. The working members of
    the Committee allowed Robespierre to theorise to his heart’s content;
    as long as he did not interfere with them, he might advocate what
    principles he pleased. The first evidence of Robespierre’s new tendency
    appeared in his establishment of the Worship of the Supreme Being. He
    was a profoundly religious and virtuous man, and the chief cause of
    his hatred of Hébert and Danton was his belief that they were immoral
    atheists. On 18th Floréal (7th May 1794) Robespierre made his most
    famous speech in the Convention, by which he induced the Convention
    to officially acknowledge the existence of a Supreme Being and the
    immortality of the soul. The speech was followed on 20th Prairial by
    a great festival in honour of the Supreme Being, at which Robespierre
    presided. This was the day when his power seemed greatest, but many of
    his colleagues laughed at his assumption of virtue and at his posing
    as a high priest. He perceived clearly that he could not establish his
    chimerical Reign of Virtue without destroying the scoffers who refused
    to believe in him and his doctrines. He absented himself for six weeks
    from the meetings of the Committee, and prepared a speech by which he
    hoped to induce the Convention to proscribe his opponents.</p>

  <p>On 8th Thermidor (26th July 1794) he read this speech to the
    Convention, and attacked covertly, and without mentioning many names,
    not only certain of his colleagues in the Committee of Public Safety,
    but also the majority of the Committee of General Security and of the
    Financial Committee. These men, who had been governing France while
    Robespierre was theorising, would not tamely submit to be ejected from
    power<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span> and guillotined. On the evening of the same day Robespierre
    read his speech to the Jacobin Club, which was the headquarters of
    the puritans who believed in the possibility of a Reign of Virtue.
    But on 9th Thermidor the accused deputies determined to act. It was
    not only the working members of the Committees, but also the friends
    of Danton, the independent deputies of the Mountain, and the members
    of the Centre, who felt threatened, and their attitude was speedily
    declared. Saint-Just began to read a report accusing Billaud-Varenne
    and Collot-d’Herbois by name, but he was interrupted, and Robespierre
    himself, with Couthon, Saint-Just, and two other deputies were, after
    a stormy scene, ordered under arrest. But the puritan party were not
    only strong in the Jacobin Club; they dominated the Commune of Paris
    ever since the overthrow of the Hébertists. Hanriot, the commandant
    of the National Guard of Paris, rescued Robespierre and the other
    imprisoned deputies, and took them to the Hôtel-de-Ville, where a
    scheme of government was discussed. The Convention did not wait to be
    attacked. It declared Robespierre and all his adherents to be outlaws,
    and Barras, Fréron, and Léonard Bourdon collected columns of regular
    troops and national guards to attack the Hôtel-de-Ville. The Convention
    was completely successful. The people of Paris, like the people of all
    France, persisted in considering Robespierre as the author of the Reign
    of Terror, while not only his enemies but his colleagues threw upon
    him the responsibility for all the atrocities included under the name
    of the Terror. Though personally he had very little influence in the
    Committee, he was represented and regarded as its master. Consequently
    no hand was raised to protect Robespierre and the puritans; the
    Hôtel-de-Ville was easily occupied by Barras; Robespierre was wounded
    in the mouth by a gendarme, and on 10th Thermidor (28th July) he was
    guillotined, and was accompanied or followed to the scaffold by the
    small group of colleagues who had been impeached with him, and by the
    majority of the Commune of Paris.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Rule of the Thermidorians. First Phase.</div>

  <p>The death of Robespierre did not lead to a change of government, but
    it led to an alteration in the system by which the government was
    administered. The deputies who had been most instrumental in the
    revolution of Thermidor belonged to the Mountain, and expected to
    retain power in their hands; but they saw the necessity of preventing
    such a permanence of power as had existed during the previous year. It
    was, therefore, resolved that the Committees of Government—that is, the
    Committees of Public Safety and of General Security—should be renewed
    by a quarter every month, and that the retiring members should not
    be eligible for re-election until a month had passed. The survivors
    of the Great Committee still believed in the system of government by
    terror, but their new colleagues understood that now that France was
    victorious the country would no longer submit to such rigorous measures
    of repression. The victory of Fleurus had done away with the necessity
    of continually employing the guillotine. The system of terror was
    therefore tacitly abandoned; the supremacy of the Committees continued;
    the Law of the Suspects was unrepealed; the Revolutionary Tribunal
    continued to exist; representatives were still sent on mission with
    unlimited powers; but the succession of executions ceased, and the
    method of government, though arbitrary, was no longer sanguinary. The
    men who ruled France from Thermidor (July) 1794 to Ventôse (March) 1795
    were deputies of the Mountain, men of the type of Carnot and Robert
    Lindet, the most sagacious of the members of the Great Committee of
    Public Safety. The most conspicuous of the new men of this period were
    Merlin of Douai and Treilhard, who took charge of the foreign policy.
    These statesmen, while Carnot superintended the carrying on of the
    war with his accustomed vigour and success, finally broke with the
    propagandist doctrines which had made the war of unparalleled magnitude
    and bitterness, and Merlin of Douai, on 14th Frimaire (4th December)
    1794 read a report in the name of the Committee<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span> of Public Safety,
    declaring that the Republic did not wish to be at war with Europe for
    ever, and laying down the bases on which treaties of peace honourable
    to France could be made. While the Thermidorians were administering
    the government strongly and honourably, they were beset with cries of
    vengeance against the Terrorists of the previous year. They felt it
    necessary to yield to the general outcry, and on 21st Brumaire, Year
    <span class="smcap">III.</span> (11th November 1794), Carrier, the most ferocious of the
    proconsuls of the Terror, was sent before the Revolutionary Tribunal.
    He was tried and eventually executed for his crimes. The agitation
    was stronger against the organisers of the Terror, Billaud-Varenne,
    and Collot-d’Herbois, with whom were associated in the popular hatred
    Barère, the reporter, and Vadier, who had been the most conspicuous
    member of the Committee of General Security. Both the doctrines and
    the men of the Terror had still plenty of supporters in Paris, who
    now dominated the Jacobin Club, which was therefore closed by the
    Thermidorians in December 1794. Almost at the same date the Law of
    the Maximum was repealed. In the same month the survivors of the
    seventy-three deputies who had protested against the proscription of
    the Girondins, and consequently been imprisoned, were recalled to their
    seats in the Convention.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Successes in other quarters.</div>

  <p>Meanwhile the series of victories which had commenced during the rule
    of the Great Committee of Public Safety continued. Pichegru at the
    head of the Army of the North pursued the English and their Dutch and
    Hanoverian allies. On the 9th of October he took Nimeguen, and forcing
    his way across the frozen rivers drove the English through Holland. He
    occupied Amsterdam, and then with his hussars took the Dutch fleet,
    which was unable to leave its moorings in the Texel owing to the ice.
    By the end of January 1795 the whole of Holland was in the possession
    of the French. The Stadtholder, the Prince of Orange, fled to England,
    and the English troops were soon after withdrawn. The conquest of
    Holland was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span> of the greatest service to the Thermidorians, for it
    enabled them, by drawing upon the wealth of that country, to relieve
    the financial distress of the French Republic. With regard to Belgium
    there was no difficulty in coming to a decision as to its future, for
    the Decree of Reunion passed in the days of Dumouriez’ success remained
    unrepealed, and the Austrian Netherlands were therefore organised as
    part of the French Republic. It was otherwise with regard to Holland.
    The Thermidorians did not desire to further aggravate the fears of
    Europe by annexing that country, but at the same time they were quite
    resolved that it should not again fall under the power of the English.
    Reubell and Sieyès, two ex-Constituants who had remained in obscurity
    during the Reign of Terror, were despatched to Holland to see what
    could be done. They found many Dutch admirers of the doctrines of
    the French Revolution, and speedily conciliated the burghers of the
    Dutch cities, who had always resented the power of the Stadtholder.
    With the help of these parties and of the Dutch patriots who had been
    exiled in 1787, and who now returned from France full of enthusiasm
    for democracy, they organised a Batavian Republic on the model of the
    French Republic, and in March 1795 a Treaty of Peace and Alliance was
    signed between the French and Batavian Republics. In other quarters
    the French Republic was likewise triumphant. Maestricht was taken
    by Kléber on the 4th of November 1794. Jourdan with the Army of the
    Sambre-and-Meuse, defeated the Austrians under Clerfayt at Aldenhoven
    on the 2d of October, and marching south occupied Aix-la-Chapelle,
    Bonn, Cologne, and Coblentz. Meanwhile the Army of the Moselle,
    under René Moreaux, finally drove the Prussians out of France and
    occupied the Palatinate and the whole of the Electorate of Trèves. On
    the southern frontier there were similar successes. The Army of the
    Eastern Pyrenees, which had invaded Catalonia, stormed the Spanish
    camp at Figueras on the 20th of November 1794, and took Rosas on
    the 3rd<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span> of February 1795. In the first of these actions the French
    General Dugommier was killed in action. Moncey, with the Army of the
    Western Pyrenees, took Bilbao, Vittoria, and San Sebastian. The Army
    of Italy won the victory of Loano on the 24th of November, which
    opened communication with Genoa. The Army of the Alps finally reached
    the summits of Mont Cenis and the Little St. Bernard, and drove the
    Piedmontese before it.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Poland. 1794–5.</div>

  <p>While the French nation had thus after much suffering and long
    submission to the Reign of Terror secured its independence and made
    itself feared by Europe, a Polish insurrection had taken place which
    was not crowned with the same success. The second partition of
    Poland, which was consummated in 1793, has been described. But the
    Polish nation was not inclined to acknowledge its extinction without
    another blow. Many Polish exiles came to France, and the leader of
    the Polish patriots, Kosciuszko, received a flattering reception,
    though no promise of active help. On the 23d of March 1794 Kosciuszko
    entered Cracow and raised the standard of national independence.
    This news caused a general rising in Prussian Poland, where the new
    administrators of Prussia had behaved with extreme cruelty. Stanislas
    Poniatowski, King of Poland, acting under the influence of the Russian
    general commanding at Warsaw, Igelstrom, disavowed Kosciuszko and
    declared him a rebel. But the Polish people welcomed Kosciuszko
    as a liberator. He defeated the Russians at Raclawice on the 4th
    of April 1794, and after a further victory occupied Warsaw on the
    19th. Both Russians and Prussians prepared to defend the provinces
    they had annexed in 1793, and laid siege to Warsaw in July 1794. By
    the beginning of September all Prussian Poland was in a flame of
    insurrection; Frederick William <span class="smcap">II.</span>, who was conducting the
    siege in person, rapidly retreated and summoned to his assistance a
    large proportion of the troops hitherto employed against France. But
    though the Prussians had temporarily retired, Catherine of Russia
    determined, at all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span> hazards, to conquer the Poles. She gathered a great
    army from all parts of her empire, and placed it under the command of
    the most famous of the Russian generals, Suvórov. Caught between the
    army of Suvórov and the army of Fersen, who had succeeded Igelstrom in
    command of the Russians already in Poland, the Polish patriots were
    utterly defeated at Maciejowice on the 12th of October 1794, when
    Kosciuszko was wounded and taken prisoner. On the 4th of November,
    Praga, the suburb of Warsaw on the right bank of the Vistula, was
    stormed by Suvórov, and on the 9th of November the capital surrendered.
    Catherine determined to complete the work of the destruction of Poland.
    Stanislas Poniatowski was removed from Poland on the 7th of January
    1795, and on the 25th of November 1795 he abdicated the throne.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Extinction of Poland. 1795.</div>

  <p>The division of the spoils caused much trouble to the allies. The
    Austrians, who had been left in the lurch at the second partition,
    claimed a share, and, like the Prussians, weakened their armies on
    the frontier of France in order to defend their claims on Poland. By
    the final partition, which was arranged between the powers in 1795,
    Prussia received Warsaw and the surrounding palatinates; Austria
    received Cracow and the rest of Galicia, and the Russians were content
    with rectifying their frontier from Grodno to Minsk. It is interesting
    to contrast the simultaneous failure of the Poles and success of the
    French. The cause lay in the fact that the great bulk of the Polish
    people were serfs, to whom it mattered little what master they served,
    whereas the French people had long thrown off the bonds of personal
    serfdom, and had just succeeded in getting rid of the last shackles of
    the privileged classes. The Polish Constitution of 1791 was the work of
    a few enlightened noblemen and priests, and was gladly accepted by the
    educated bourgeois of the cities, but the peasants were in too degraded
    a condition to understand what personal liberty meant. In France every
    peasant, every farmer had profited by the Revolution, and was wedded to
    its cause not only for political<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span> reasons, but because of the purchases
    of ecclesiastical property which he had made. The national feeling in
    France embraced the whole people, and made France successful against
    her foreign foes; the national feeling in Poland only existed among
    a minority of the population, and the result was that Kosciuszko was
    unable to attain the triumph which he so well merited.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Change in the attitude of Continental Powers.</div>

  <p>The successes of the French Republic and the failure of the Polish
    national movement affected the attitude of the coalition both towards
    France and towards its own members. The Prussians, ever since the
    defeat of Brunswick in 1792, had openly expressed their belief that the
    Austrians were betraying them and using them as catspaws. Frederick
    William <span class="smcap">II.</span> for a long time battled against these views,
    which were held by the chief Prussian statesmen, such as Haugwitz and
    Alvensleben, by the most respected Prussian generals such as Kalkreuth
    and Möllendorf, and by his own personal clique of favourites, headed
    by Lucchesini. In the year 1793 he had confined his operations against
    France to the siege of Mayence, while his best troops were directed
    on Poland, and in 1794 he had still further reduced the number of
    his soldiers upon the Rhine. England, which had paid large subsidies
    to the Prussian government, resented this conduct, and declared its
    intention of withdrawing all subsidies unless Prussia would do as she
    was directed. Frederick William <span class="smcap">II.</span> declared that he would not
    receive the English subsidies on these terms; but the truth was, that
    his attention was far more occupied by the gains he hoped to get in
    Poland than with the prosecution of the war against France. Austria,
    also, where Thugut had in 1794 become the nominal as well as the real
    director of the foreign policy of the Emperor Francis, was getting
    tired of the war with France. Prussia’s conduct in making the second
    partition of Poland in 1793, and leaving the Emperor out, had sown the
    seeds of discontent. Thugut was determined that the same thing should
    not occur again, and, therefore, when the Polish insurrection broke
    out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span> in 1794, Austria also denuded her armies upon the French frontier.
    This attitude of Prussia and Austria does not entirely account for
    the victories of the French republican armies, but it explains to
    some extent the ease with which those victories were obtained. Spain
    also was weary of the war. Godoy felt that his tenure of office was
    imperilled by the existence of two French armies in Spain which might
    easily march upon Madrid, and the Queen, and therefore the King, was
    entirely under the influence of Godoy. Many of the princes of the
    Holy Roman Empire likewise wished to see the war at an end, for it
    was their states upon the left bank of the Rhine which were occupied
    by the French armies; it was their states upon the right bank of the
    Rhine which would be invaded by the passage of that river, whereas the
    home dominions of Austria and Prussia were far to the east, and not
    likely to be reached by an invading army. England was the only power
    which seriously desired to prosecute the war, for in England a national
    feeling of repulsion against the French had arisen. The English
    government, however, was unable to strike any effective blow; Hoche
    destroyed a body of <i>émigrés</i> landed from English ships at Quiberon Bay
    in July 1794; the continental powers who received subsidies were not
    very earnest in doing the work for which they were paid; the French
    occupation of Holland had deprived England of the only base from which
    an army could act in Europe; and the English government had therefore
    to be contented with blockading the French ports and occupying the
    French West Indian Colonies.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Insurrection of 12th Germinal. 1st April 1795.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Insurrection of 1st Prairial. 20th May 1795.</div>

  <p>The recall of those sympathisers with the Girondin party, who had been
    imprisoned, in December 1794 was followed in March 1795 by the recall
    to their seats in the Convention of the outlawed Girondin leaders, of
    whom the most conspicuous were Lanjuinais and Louvet. The return of
    these victims increased the clamour against the surviving Terrorist
    leaders and proconsuls who had ruled France in 1793–94 in Paris, or
    on mission in the provinces. Hot debates took place on the necessity
    of punishing what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span> was now termed ‘Robespierre’s tail.’ In Paris a
    powerful section of the populace—namely, the young bourgeois, who
    were commonly called the Jeunesse Dorée, or after their leader Fréron
    the Jeunesse Fréronienne—never ceased to demand the punishment of the
    Terrorists. Popular sympathy was generally with the Jeunesse Dorée;
    conspicuous Jacobins of the Terror were beaten in the streets; the
    heart of Marat was taken from the Pantheon and thrown down a sewer; and
    the busts of Marat, who was regarded as the apostle of Terrorism, were
    everywhere broken. The former rulers of Paris, the old members of the
    Jacobin Club and the Revolutionary Committees, were not inclined to
    submit to popular vengeance without striking a blow. On 12th Germinal,
    Year <span class="smcap">III.</span> (1st April 1795) they raised an insurrection in the
    turbulent Faubourg Saint-Antoine, and the insurgents broke into the
    Convention shouting ‘Bread and the Constitution of 1793.’ The only
    result of this riot was that Billaud-Varenne, Collot-d’Herbois, Barère,
    and Vadier were ordered to be deported to French Guiana without trial.
    The persecution of the Terrorists continued. A commission was appointed
    to inquire into the acts of the former proconsuls; power passed into
    the hands of the returned Girondins and the members of the Plain or
    Centre. Certain of the remaining deputies of the Mountain, supported
    by the Jacobins of Paris, then resolved on a second insurrection. On
    1st Prairial, Year <span class="smcap">III.</span> (20th May 1795) the Convention was
    again invaded by a Saint-Antoine mob, headed by women who had gained
    the unenviable name of the ‘Furies of the Guillotine.’ A deputy named
    Féraud was taken for Fréron and murdered on the spot, and throughout
    the day the hall of the Convention was occupied by a howling mob,
    which vainly endeavoured to compel the President, Boissy-d’Anglas, to
    pass the decrees they desired. Meanwhile the Committees of Government
    prepared to act with vigour. With the help of some regular troops
    quartered in Paris, of the national guards of the bourgeois sections,
    and of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span> Jeunesse Dorée, they expelled the mob, and on the following
    days a force composed of these elements under the command of General
    Menou, an ex-Constituant, disarmed the revolutionary sections. The
    victory of the Committees was the victory of the enemies of the Reign
    of Terror. Some of the former Terrorist deputies were condemned to
    death and committed suicide, others were impeached and placed under
    arrest, and the Mountain as a party ceased to exist. The expulsion of
    the deputies of the Mountain caused the Committees of Government to be
    filled by the members of the Centre, the men who during the Reign of
    Terror had been peacefully occupied in the legislative and educational
    reforms, which were the most lasting works of the Convention. Of
    these new members the most typical is Cambacérès, the great jurist
    and principal law reformer of the period, on whose labours Napoleon
    compiled the Code Civil. While the Committees were engaged in the work
    of government, a commission of eleven deputies was appointed to draw up
    a new Constitution which should avoid the errors of its predecessors.
    The chief authors of this Constitution, which is known as the
    Constitution of the Year <span class="smcap">III.</span>, were Boissy-d’Anglas and Daunou.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Treaties of Basle. 1795.</div>

  <p>The direction of foreign policy was still mainly conducted by Merlin
    of Douai, who was now aided in this department by Cambacérès,
    Sieyès, and Reubell. Their great work—indeed the great work of the
    Thermidorians—was the conclusion of the Treaties of Basle. The causes
    of these treaties have been shown in the examination just made of the
    changed attitude of the powers of Europe towards the French Republic.
    The agent of the French Republic in Switzerland, Barthélemy, was the
    diplomatist who negotiated the series of treaties. Switzerland had
    throughout the Reign of Terror been the centre of diplomatic action,
    for in Switzerland alone France could meet the representatives of
    foreign powers. The first and the most important of the Treaties of
    Basle was that between France and Prussia, which was signed upon the
    5th of April 1795. By it not only was peace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span> concluded between the
    contracting powers, but a line of demarcation was agreed to be drawn
    by which Prussia might secure safety from French invasion for the
    states of Northern Germany. One point only was left in abeyance by
    Barthélemy and Hardenberg, the negotiators of this treaty. The French
    Government insisted that France, in reward for her exertions, and in
    compensation for the long war, should receive her natural limits of the
    Rhine. Prussia’s territory upon the left bank of the Rhine was very
    small in amount, and it was agreed that the amount of compensation she
    should receive for ceding it to France should be left unsettled for the
    present. Frederick William <span class="smcap">II.</span>, who posed as a guardian of
    the Holy Roman Empire, refused openly to assent to the doctrine that
    France should reach the Rhine and thus consecrate the infringement of
    the limits of the Empire. He had no desire to appear ready to consent
    to any such arrangement, for he felt that such a policy would leave to
    Austria the position of protector of the Empire. The Treaty of Basle
    with Prussia was succeeded at the same place by a treaty with Spain
    on the 22d of July, and finally by a treaty with the most energetic
    of the petty princes of the Empire, the Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel,
    on the 29th of August. Peace had already on February 9th been made
    with Tuscany, which had most unwillingly declared war on France under
    pressure from England. Of these treaties, the most important was that
    with Spain, which was excessively popular at Madrid, and won for Godoy
    the high-sounding title of ‘Prince of the Peace.’ Thus, after three
    years of war, France re-entered the comity of nations and broke up the
    coalition formed against her independence.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Result of the Treaties of Basle.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> conclusion of the Treaties of Basle in the spring and summer of
    1795 brought France once more into a recognised position among the
    nations of Europe. The idea of a revolutionary propaganda had been
    entirely abandoned by the leading Thermidorians, who looked upon it as
    the first duty of the French Government to secure peace for France.
    All the great statesmen of the revolutionary period, from Mirabeau to
    Danton<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span> and Robespierre, had protested against the absurd notion that
    it was the mission of France to secure the pre-eminence of democratic
    ideas throughout the whole of Europe. Events had shown that it was a
    task of quite sufficient difficulty to secure the prevalence of such
    ideas in France. The abandonment of the revolutionary propaganda broke
    up the league of old Europe against new France. When the Prussian
    state, and still more the ancient monarchy of Spain, had consented to
    make peace with France, the rest of the powers of the Continent felt
    that they could no longer affect to treat the French republicans as
    beyond the pale of humanity, or the French Republic as having destroyed
    the title of France to be reckoned as a nation.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Constitution of the Year III.</div>

  <p>The Thermidorians, not satisfied with their diplomatic success,
    constructed a new government for France. The authors of the policy,
    which resulted in the Treaties of Basle, were also the sponsors of
    the ‘Constitution of the Year <span class="smcap">III.</span>’ The task of drawing up
    the bases of a new Constitution was referred upon 14th Germinal, Year
    <span class="smcap">III.</span> (3d April 1795) to a committee of seven deputies, but
    the details were worked out by a subsequent commission of eleven.
    Among the seven the most important were Sieyès, Cambacérès, and Merlin
    of Douai, who were also at this period the three principal members
    of the Committee of Public Safety. Just as in making the Treaties of
    Basle, they and their colleagues had recurred to the fundamental ideas
    and policy of the old French Monarchy, so in the new Constitution
    they exhibited the influence of bygone ideas. The experience of the
    Constituent and Legislative Assemblies, and of the Convention until
    the formation of the Committee of Public Safety, had shown the utter
    inadequacy of intrusting supreme executive and administrative authority
    to an unwieldy deliberative assembly. The power of the monarchy in
    all modern states has rested upon the conviction of the importance
    of consolidating, as far as possible, the executive authority; the
    founders of the United States of America understood this truth, and
    invested their President<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span> with power resembling that exercised by
    kings; and the Convention, when it yielded to the voice of Danton,
    and conferred supreme authority upon the Committee of Public Safety,
    had reaped the advantage in its victories upon all the frontiers.
    Even the most obtuse of the deputies who sat in the Convention had
    learnt this lesson. And the founders of the Constitution of the Year
    <span class="smcap">III.</span> had no difficulty in carrying the most important point
    in their programme. This was the entire separation of the executive
    and legislative powers. The Constitution of 1791, in its jealousy of
    the monarchy, had practically deprived the king and his ministers of
    all real authority, while leaving him the entire responsibility. The
    Constitution of 1793 had placed all executive authority in the hands of
    the Legislature. The Constitution of the Year <span class="smcap">III.</span> endeavoured
    to separate the executive and legislative authorities.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Directory.</div>

  <p>Under the new arrangement the executive was placed in the hands of
    five Directors. One was to retire every year and was not eligible
    for re-election; his successor was to be chosen by the Legislature.
    In order to secure an entire separation between the members of the
    Directory and of the Legislature, no member of the latter could
    be elected a Director until twelve months had elapsed after the
    resignation of his seat. The Directors were to appoint the Ministers,
    who were to have no connection whatever with the Legislature, and who
    were to act as the agents of the Directors. The individual Directors
    were to exercise no authority in their own names. They were to live
    under the same roof in the Palace of the Luxembourg at Paris. They were
    to meet daily, and the will of the majority was to be taken as the will
    of the whole. They were to elect a President every month, who was to
    act as their mouthpiece at the reception of foreign ambassadors and on
    all occasions of ceremony. The control of the internal administration,
    the management of the armies and fleets, and all questions of foreign
    policy were entirely left to the Directors. But treaties, declarations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
    of war and similar acts had to be ratified by the Legislature. The
    Directors had nothing whatever to do with the work of legislation, and
    their assent was not needed to new laws. With regard to the revenue,
    the administration of the finances and of the treasury rested with the
    Directors, but they could not impose fresh taxes without the assent of
    the Legislature.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Legislature.</div>

  <p>The Legislature, under the Constitution of the Year <span class="smcap">III.</span>
    consisted of two chambers—the Council of Ancients and the Council
    of Five Hundred. It is a curious commentary upon the debates which
    took place in the Constituent Assembly in August 1789, when the
    establishment of two chambers was rejected with scorn as being an
    obvious imitation of the English Parliament, that in 1795 this very
    principle was almost unanimously adopted. The experience of the
    three great revolutionary assemblies had convinced Sieyès and his
    colleagues of the inexpediency of leaving important measures to be
    decided in a single chamber. The delay necessitated by a law being
    obliged to pass before two distinct deliberative bodies now appeared
    most advantageous, when compared with the headlong precipitation which
    had marked all the earlier stages of the Revolution. The Council of
    Ancients was to consist of men forty-five years old and upwards, and,
    therefore, presumably not liable to be carried away by sudden bursts of
    enthusiasm. For the Council of Five Hundred there was no limitation of
    age, and elderly men were not precluded from being returned to it. The
    Council of Five Hundred consisted, as its name implies, of five hundred
    deputies; the Council of Ancients of two hundred and fifty. Dictated
    by experience, also, were the measures taken for the election of
    deputies. In order to avoid the inconvenience which had resulted from
    the election of an entirely new body of representatives at one and the
    same moment, as had happened in 1791, it was resolved that one-third of
    the two Councils should retire yearly. Deputies were to be chosen by
    an elaborate system of primary and secondary assemblies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span> held in each
    department of France, and a property qualification was demanded both
    for the electors and the deputies. With these safeguards Sieyès and his
    colleagues believed they had secured a practical means of obviating
    all the errors of the past. The Council of Five Hundred had allotted
    to it as its special function the initiation of all fresh taxation and
    the revision of all money bills. The Council of Ancients was the court
    of appeal in diplomatic questions, such as the declaration of war. In
    actual legislation the consent of the majority of both chambers was
    needed for a new law. For their most important function—the yearly
    election of a new Director—the two chambers were to form one united
    assembly.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Local Administration of France.</div>

  <p>By this Constitution, the conspicuous drawbacks of the two former
    Constitutions, namely, the enforced weakness of the executive and
    the undefined powers of the Legislature were avoided. But the local
    administration established by the Constitution of 1791 had proved so
    excellent that it was only slightly modified and not radically altered.
    The great achievement of the Constituent Assembly—the abolition of old
    provincial jealousies by the division of France into departments—was
    maintained. The wise step which had been taken by the Great Committee
    of Public Safety in abolishing the directories of the departments
    and of the districts was sanctioned, and the council-generals were
    left to act alone. The main distinction between the administrative
    systems of 1791 and 1795 was that the elected <i>procureurs-syndics</i>
    and <i>procureurs-généraux-syndics</i>, established by the former, were
    replaced by officials nominated by the supreme executive at Paris.
    These officials went under the name of agents during the Directory,
    but possessed the same authority and carried out the same functions as
    the <i>sous-préfets</i> and <i>préfets</i> afterwards appointed by Napoleon. The
    courts of justice, whether local, appellant, or supreme, established by
    the Constitution of 1791, were left untouched by the Constitution of
    the Year <span class="smcap">III.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span></span></p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Insurrection of Vendémiaire.</div>

  <p>In spite of the glories of the conquest of Holland, the passage of
    the Rhine, the victory of Quiberon, and the invasion of Spain,—in
    spite of the even greater credit justly earned by the Treaties of
    Basle,—in spite of the new Constitution, which, if faulty in places,
    was superior to those which had preceded it—the Thermidorians were
    intensely unpopular in France. The recollection of the Reign of
    Terror weighed upon the imaginations of the people even after the
    death of Robespierre, the deportation of Billaud-Varenne, and the
    closing of the Jacobin Club. The Convention was still in the minds of
    men shrouded by the remembrance of the innocent blood that had been
    shed. The inauguration of the new constitutional system was looked
    upon as an opportunity for driving the members of the Convention from
    power, and threats of vengeance were everywhere heard against them.
    Intriguers, some of them possibly royalists, who desired the return
    of the Bourbons, but most of them bourgeois or aristocrats who had
    personal reasons for desiring revenge, hoped to take advantage of this
    general feeling to overthrow the Republic. But the mass of Frenchmen
    were sincerely republican, and were clear-sighted enough to perceive
    that the return of the Bourbons would be followed by the loss of the
    material advantages that had been gained by the sale of the lands of
    the Church and the nobility. The members of the Convention understood
    the intentions of the intriguers, and understood also that the French
    people sincerely loved the Republic. They proceeded to frustrate the
    designs of their enemies by decreeing that two-thirds of the new
    Legislature must be elected from among the deputies of the Convention.
    The intriguers in Paris, thus foiled in their expectations of a certain
    majority in the new Legislature, tried to rouse the people of Paris
    into active insurrection. There can be no doubt that not only in Paris,
    but throughout France, the action of the Convention in ordering the
    election of so large a proportion of the old deputies was profoundly
    unpopular, but it was one thing to dislike a measure and another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span> thing
    to involve France in a fresh revolution. In the provincial towns there
    was universal grumbling but no active opposition. In Paris, however,
    where the intriguers abounded, it was hoped that the <i>jeunesse dorée</i>,
    who had played so great a part in the previous winter, assisted by the
    bourgeois Sections, would be able by making an imposing display of
    force to compel the Convention to revoke the obnoxious decree.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Fighting in Paris, 13th Vendémiaire (5th October 1795).</div>

  <p>This project of the agitators in Paris was soon known in the
    Convention, and had the result of causing the divided forces of the
    Thermidorians to close up their ranks. The three chief groups in this
    party were the returned Girondins, the leaders of the Plain, and
    the former adherents of the Terror. The leaders of all these groups
    united in the presence of a common danger, for they felt that the
    dissolution of the Convention without some such measure of security
    as the re-election of the two-thirds to the forthcoming Legislature
    would lead to their own proscription. They therefore appointed Barras,
    who had commanded in the attack upon the Hôtel-de-Ville upon the
    9th Thermidor of the previous year, and overthrown the supporters
    of Robespierre assembled there, to watch over their safety. Barras
    summoned to his assistance Napoleon Bonaparte, who was then in Paris
    engaged in protesting against his recall from the Army of Italy. The
    antecedents of this young general, his well-known Jacobin principles
    and his former friendship for Augustin Robespierre, had led to his
    recall and to his being placed upon the unemployed list. Barras had
    under his command the garrison of regular troops quartered in Paris and
    the armed guards of the Convention. The Royalist agitators counted on
    the <i>jeunesse dorée</i> and the bourgeois Sections. Bonaparte perceived
    that in numbers each party was evenly matched, and he at once sent for
    the artillery quartered at Meudon. The Convention declared itself <i>en
      permanence</i>, the troops were stationed round the Tuileries, Bonaparte’s
    guns were mounted in the gardens and the Place du Carrousel. The attack
    on the Convention was made on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span> the 13th Vendémiaire (5th October) in a
    very slovenly manner. No effort had been made to concentrate the force
    of the assailants at a given moment, and as the first column marched
    carelessly down without recognised leaders, it was fired upon and
    almost entirely cut to pieces by Bonaparte’s artillery. Nevertheless
    column after column of devoted national guards approached the Tuileries
    with the utmost gallantry to meet the same fate. The insurrection of
    13th Vendémiaire cannot be compared with the other famous insurrections
    of the 14th July 1789 and 10th August 1792, for not one of the
    defenders of the Convention was wounded. It was a butchery, not a
    battle.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The First Directors.</div>

  <p>The Convention, conscious of its unpopularity, and not desiring to
    increase it, made but slight efforts to discover and punish the
    leaders of the insurrection of 13th Vendémiaire. Only a few military
    executions, after trial by court-martial, of a few prisoners taken with
    arms in their hands were permitted, and no vigour was shown in hunting
    down even the most conspicuous agitators. It was resolved at once to
    proceed to the election of the first Directors under the new system.
    Sieyès refused to be one of them. It was generally agreed, though not
    formally declared, that the first Directors should all be deputies of
    the Convention who had voted for the death of Louis XVI., and who might
    therefore be presumed to be faithful to republican institutions, if not
    from inclination at least from fear. The five deputies actually elected
    were—Barras, whose conduct on the 9th Thermidor, and on the 13th
    Vendémiaire, had obtained for him the gratitude of the majority of the
    deputies; Reubell, an ex-Constituant and an Alsatian, who was believed
    to have a special knowledge of foreign affairs; Revellière-Lépeaux,
    another ex-Constituant, a member of the Committee of Public Safety, a
    good lawyer, and the future inventor of a new religion; Carnot, the
    famous military member of the Great Committee of Public Safety, who
    was selected for his strategic ability; and Letourneur, an ex-officer
    of Engineers, like Carnot, who was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span> expected to act as Carnot’s
    assistant. To the Council of Ancients and the Council of Five Hundred
    were elected among the two-thirds chosen from the Convention the more
    conspicuous Thermidorians, including Sieyès, Cambacérès, Tallien, and
    Treilhard. The six first ministers were appointed by the Directors on
    14th Brumaire (5th November). They were Merlin of Douai and Charles
    Delacroix, two ex-deputies of the Convention who had not been elected
    to the new Legislature, appointed to the Ministries of Justice and
    of Foreign Affairs, Aubert-Dubayet, a distinguished general, to the
    Ministry of War, and Faypoult, Benezech and Admiral Truguet to the
    Ministries of Finance, the Interior, and the Marine.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Dissolution of the Convention.</div>

  <p>The first Directors elected and the new Legislature constituted, the
    Convention had to decree its own dissolution. The three years during
    which it had sat are perhaps the most important and most critical in
    the whole history of France. The Convention had not merely witnessed
    the rise and fall of many cliques and many parties; it had allowed the
    Reign of Terror to be established, and had punished its inventors with
    death or deportation. It had passed through nearly every variety of
    government, and had seen France in her greatest degradation and at the
    height of her success. Its last act, passed on the very day on which it
    dissolved itself, 4th Brumaire (26th October), was worthy of its best
    and greatest days, for it was an act declaring a complete amnesty for
    all political offences, or supposed offences, since the declaration of
    the Republic.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">England and the Emigrés.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Treason of Pichegru.</div>

  <p>The successful establishment of the Directory and the victory won
    over the royalist agitators on 13th Vendémiaire had a profound effect
    upon the policy of England. Hitherto Pitt and Grenville, inspired
    by their agent in Switzerland, William Wickham, had believed in the
    vain promises of the royalist <i>émigrés</i>, and had hoped by their means
    to restore the Bourbon monarchy in France. The headquarters of the
    royalist agitators were, as they had always been, in Switzerland.
    Neither the Comte de Provence, who,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span> since his nephew’s death, called
    himself Louis <i>XVIII.</i>, nor the Comte d’Artois were really deceived
    by the hopes held out by their royalist friends. But the English
    ministers, deluded by the extravagant promises of the <i>émigrés</i> and by
    the reports of Wickham, considered the prospects of an overthrow of
    the Republic to be excellent. They had shown their confidence in the
    <i>émigrés</i> by the active assistance they had given to the expedition to
    Quiberon Bay, and still more by the large sums of secret-service money
    which had been expended in Switzerland. The efforts of the royalist
    <i>émigrés</i> took two directions; on the one hand, they had fomented the
    feeling of discontent in Paris which had culminated in the insurrection
    of 13th Vendémiaire, and, on the other, they had attempted to affect
    the loyalty of the generals of the Republic. The general on whom they
    counted most was Pichegru, the conqueror of Holland. This general, like
    Dumouriez in 1793, was more ambitious to attain wealth and power for
    himself than success for the Republic. During his sojourn in Paris in
    the spring of 1795 he had formed a close alliance with the royalist
    agitators in the capital, and on proceeding to take up the command of
    the Army of the Rhine-and-Moselle he entered into direct communications
    with the Prince de Condé, the general commanding the <i>émigré</i> army
    in Germany. Condé promised Pichegru the government of Alsace, the
    Château of Chambord, a million livres in cash, an income of two hundred
    thousand livres a year, and the rank of Marshal of France, if he would
    undertake to restore the Bourbons. Great hopes were built upon these
    negotiations, and the Comte de Provence left Verona to take part in
    them. But the success of these intrigues was nullified by the victory
    of 13th Vendémiaire; the Margrave of Baden-Baden refused to allow the
    Pretender to enter his territory; Wickham was unwillingly convinced
    that the purchase of the general did not include the purchase of his
    army; and the Directory, as soon as it had firmly seized the reins of
    power, recalled Pichegru, whose transactions with Condé had been more
    than suspected, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span> replaced him by a thorough republican, Moreau.
    These failures convinced Pitt and Grenville that there was no advantage
    to be gained in trusting to the promises of the <i>émigrés</i>.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Exchange of Madame Royale.</div>

  <p>The Directory, on assuming power, resolved to continue the policy
    of the Thermidorians, and not to recur to the notions of the
    revolutionary propaganda. It desired to show Europe that France was
    ready to enter into the comity of nations, and did not presume for
    the future to interfere with the internal arrangements of other
    countries. It, therefore, on grounds of humanity, took up again the
    negotiations which had been commenced in July 1793 for the release
    of the children of Louis <span class="smcap">XVI.</span>, and, using Spain as an
    intermediary, entered into communications on this subject with the
    bitterest enemy of France—Austria. The death of the Dauphin, commonly
    called Louis <span class="smcap">XVII.</span>, had left only one of the children of
    Louis <span class="smcap">XVI.</span> and Marie Antoinette in the hands of the Republic.
    The Thermidorians had, at the instigation of one of their leaders,
    Boissy-d’Anglas, seen the expediency of proving to Europe that the
    French republicans were not barbarians, by offering to surrender the
    person of Madame Royale to her Austrian relatives. This project was
    carried out by the Directory. On 20th December 1795 Madame Royale was
    exchanged in Switzerland for the four deputies and the Minister of
    War whom Dumouriez had handed over to the Austrians, and for another
    deputy, Drouet, the former postmaster at Sainte-Menehould, who had been
    taken prisoner by the Austrians in 1793.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Desire for Peace in France.</div>

  <p>The exchange of Madame Royale was a manifest evidence of the desire
    of the Directors to conclude peace. The Prussian ambassador at Paris
    reported to his government on 28th December 1795, ‘The general cry in
    Paris is, “Make peace and you will have money and bread.”’<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Peace,
    indeed, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>was the desire not only of the people of Paris, but of the
    people of all France, of the majority in the new Legislature, and
    of the Directory. It was hoped that the Treaties of Basle were but
    the preliminaries of a general peace throughout Europe. But the two
    remaining enemies of the French Republic, England and Austria, did not
    see their way to meeting the Directory halfway. Pitt and Grenville
    argued that a peace made with the Directory would be only of the nature
    of a truce. They were ready enough to make peace, but considered it
    inadvisable to negotiate with a government which seemed to them in
    its essence unstable. Owing either to the intrigues of the <i>émigrés</i>,
    or to their own knowledge of politics, they grasped the fact that the
    new government of France was constructed on a faulty basis, and that a
    peace concluded with it would not be lasting. The attitude of Austria
    was somewhat different. Thugut, the Austrian minister, believed that
    France was exhausted, and that by a continuance of war substantial
    concessions could be wrung from her. Reubell, the Director who took
    charge of the conduct of Foreign Affairs, expressed himself as follows
    to the Prussian ambassador at Paris: ‘The war with Austria troubles us
    less than the war with England. Our means for supporting the former
    are ready, but not without having exhausted all the resources of the
    Republic. It will be probably the last effort of the two belligerent
    powers.... Our plan of campaign is almost settled; the war will be
    defensive in Germany and offensive in Italy. It is important to us to
    detach Austria from England and Sardinia from Austria.’<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Contrary
    to their wish, therefore, the Directors found themselves obliged to
    continue the war with England and Austria.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">France and Prussia.</div>

  <p>While continuing the war with these two powers, the French Directory,
    like the Thermidorians, hoped to obtain not only the neutrality of
    Prussia and Spain, which had been secured by the Treaties of Basle,
    but their active co-operation. One of its first diplomatic endeavours
    was to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>enter into close relations with Prussia. Some of the ministers
    of Frederick William <span class="smcap">II.</span>, notably Alvensleben, were in favour
    of an alliance with France; but the King himself, though he had been
    forced by the emptiness of his treasury, and his projects on Poland to
    make peace with the French republicans, looked on the idea of making an
    alliance with them with horror. In this attitude he was supported by
    his two ablest ministers, Haugwitz and Hardenberg. By the terms of the
    Treaty of Basle Hardenberg had secured the preponderance of Prussia in
    northern Germany. A line of demarcation or neutrality was drawn across
    Germany, and the northern states, which were thus freed from the fear
    of a French invasion, looked to Prussia as their leader and saviour.
    An excuse for not forming an offensive and defensive alliance with
    France was found in the occupation by the French troops of the Prussian
    territories on the left bank of the Rhine. Prussia would only negotiate
    on the basis of the restoration of the <i>status quo ante bellum</i>, and
    the French Directory, like its predecessors, the Thermidorian Committee
    of Public Safety and the Great Committee of Public Safety, insisted on
    the cession to France of all territory up to the Rhine. The Directors,
    had they wished, could not have opposed the universal feeling in France
    in favour of making the Rhine the frontier, and proposed that Prussia
    should take compensation for its cessions on the left bank of the
    Rhine, by secularising the bishoprics and abbeys of northern Germany
    and annexing their territories. This proposal, which would bring in
    its train the overthrow of the Constitution of the Holy Roman Empire,
    could not be sponsored by Prussia. The policy of Frederick the Great
    had been to assume that Prussia, not Austria, was the true defender of
    the rights of the Empire, and his nephew, in spite of Alvensleben’s
    representations, feared to break with the hereditary policy. The
    arrangement with regard to the line of demarcation had placed Prussia
    in the position of the guardian of the Empire; the acceptance of
    the French propositions would have made her seem its destroyer. The
    attempts of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span> Directory, and afterwards of the Consulate, to secure
    an alliance with Prussia, were therefore foredoomed to failure.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">France and the Smaller States.</div>

  <p>The victories of the French Republic were received with more than
    toleration in the smaller states of Europe, which feared the
    aggressions of Austria, Prussia, and Russia far more than any invasion
    by the French. Switzerland had profited greatly by the strict
    neutrality it had maintained. The wealth of France had poured freely
    into the cantons for the purchase of provisions and other necessaries;
    the residence of the diplomatists of Europe at Berne, the headquarters
    of Wickham, and at Basle, the headquarters of the French minister
    Barthélemy, had also been profitable to the country, while the Swiss,
    ready as ever to accept money from all sides, were enabled to make very
    considerable gains. Of the Princes of Italy, Ferdinand, Grand Duke of
    Tuscany, and brother of the Emperor, had, to the disgust of the Court
    of Vienna, made a separate peace with the French Republic in February
    1795; Ferdinand of Naples had followed his example, and the King of
    Sardinia alone remained in armed opposition to France. With Portugal
    the Directory and the Committee of Public Safety, refused to treat,
    for, like the French statesmen throughout the eighteenth century,
    the Directors regarded Portugal as merely a province of England.
    With the smaller northern powers the Directory established the most
    friendly relations. Christian VII. of Denmark had always maintained his
    neutrality, and through the French minister, resident at his Court,
    many important secret negotiations had passed with Prussia. In Sweden,
    Charles, Duke of Sudermania, the guardian of the young King Gustavus
    <span class="smcap">IV.</span>, abandoned the policy of Gustavus III., and now made a
    treaty of friendship and a commercial treaty with the French Republic.
    The only other state to be mentioned is Turkey. The Turks looked upon
    the events which were passing in the West of Europe with unconcern;
    still they were inclined to be friendly with the French Republic,
    because it was engaged in fighting with Austria, and thus distracted
    the attention of one of the hereditary enemies of the Sublime Porte.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Russia.</div>

  <p>Catherine of Russia, now at the close of her long reign, still regarded
    the French Revolution as affording a happy opportunity for her to
    pursue her schemes on Poland without active interference from Prussia
    or Austria. Her one desire was that France should continue the war,
    and for this reason she cordially received at her court the Comte
    d’Artois, and encouraged the presence of French <i>émigrés</i>. The Treaties
    of Basle had greatly offended her, for Prussia was thus left free to
    interfere in Poland, but Catherine was too wise to attempt to do more
    than intrigue with the affairs of Western Europe. She had no idea of
    intervening actively.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Campaign of 1795.</div>

  <p>The campaign of 1795 on the Rhine frontier is chiefly important in
    regard to the treason of Pichegru. The Elector of Bavaria, who was at
    the same time the Elector Palatine, had, as has already been said,
    been uniformly friendly to the French. It was by his connivance that
    two of the most important fortresses upon the Rhine, Mannheim and
    Düsseldorf, were surrendered to Pichegru and Jourdan respectively.
    Meanwhile Marceau besieged the fortress of Ehrenbreitstein, and Kléber
    the city of Mayence. There can be little doubt, though it is not
    absolutely proved by documents, that it was because of the negotiations
    he had commenced with the Prince de Condé that Pichegru did not
    advance into Germany. Jourdan, who did advance with the Army of the
    Sambre-and-Meuse, therefore found himself unprotected on his right,
    and was forced to retire with considerable loss. Marceau succeeded in
    taking Ehrenbreitstein, but the same treacherous inaction of Pichegru
    allowed the Austrian General Clerfayt to force Kléber to raise the
    siege of Mayence. It was on 20th October 1795 that Jourdan recrossed
    the Rhine; on the 29th Kléber was driven from before Mayence; and on
    the 30th Pichegru was defeated and driven behind the Queich. The first
    operations of the French armies under the Directory were, thus, owing
    to Pichegru’s treachery, unsuccessful, and on the 21st December an
    armistice was made between the French and the Austrians on the Rhine.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
    In the north, owing to the Treaties of Basle, there were no military
    operations of importance during the autumn of 1795, and the French
    army maintained its position on the frontier of Holland. In the south
    considerable alterations were made. The treaty of peace with Spain
    enabled the experienced and warlike soldiers of the two armies of
    the Pyrenees to be despatched to reinforce the Army of Italy, which
    was also joined by the bulk of the troops of the Army of the Alps.
    General Schérer, who commanded the Army of Italy, pushed forward, and
    by a victory at Loano on the 24th November 1795, opened up a direct
    communication with Genoa and cut off the Sardinians from the sea. In
    the four armies of the Directory which had thus taken the place of the
    thirteen armies of the Republic, there were under arms at the close of
    1795 about 300,000 men under experienced generals, excluding what was
    known as the Army of the Interior, which guarded Paris and garrisoned
    the chief cities of France.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Campaign in Italy, 1796. First Stage.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Armistice of Cherasco. April 28, 1796.</div>

  <p>Reubell, in his conversation with the Prussian ambassador at Paris,
    openly declared that the chief military effort of France in 1796 was
    to be made in Italy. Hitherto the Army of Italy had been overshadowed
    by the operations of the armies engaged upon the Rhine; but the
    Directory now desired to attack Austria in a vital place. Upon the
    Rhine they were in reality waging war with the Empire and not with
    Austria. Mayence, for instance, was the capital of an Elector, not an
    Austrian city, and blows struck in that quarter affected the Empire
    and the petty princes of the Empire far more than they did Austria.
    But in Italy the House of Austria owned an important possession in
    the Milanese. Between the Milanese and the French Army of Italy was
    Piedmont, the principal state of the King of Sardinia. Victor Amadeus
    <span class="smcap">III.</span> of Sardinia was the only petty monarch in Europe who
    had not attempted to make peace with the French Republic. In his
    resentment at the loss of Savoy and Nice he had thrown himself into
    the arms of Austria, and had borrowed an Austrian general, Colli, to
    command his small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span> but well equipped army. This was the situation
    when Napoleon Bonaparte, who had been nominated to the command of the
    Army of Italy by the Directory, on the proposition of Barras, to whom
    he had rendered such signal service on 13th Vendémiaire, arrived to
    take up his new command on the 27th of March 1796. He understood the
    policy of the Directory, and determined to crush the King of Sardinia
    first, in order to be free to attack the Austrians in the Milanese. He
    therefore turned the Maritime Alps and separated the Austrian from the
    Sardinian army. The rapidity of his success was such as to surprise the
    Directors. After turning the Alps Bonaparte struck north and defeated
    the Sardinians at Montenotte, Millesimo, and Dego on the 12th, 13th,
    and 15th April, stormed their camp at Ceva on 16th April, and finally
    defeated them at Mondovi on 22d April. He then threatened Turin, and
    the King of Sardinia signed an armistice with him at Cherasco on 28th
    April, abandoning to the French army his most important frontier
    fortresses. As the first result of these military operations the King
    of Sardinia sued for peace, which he was only granted on recognising
    the cession to France of Savoy and Nice, and as a second result General
    Bonaparte was enabled to attack the Austrians in Lombardy without
    leaving a hostile power behind him.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Campaign in Italy. Second Stage.</div>

  <p>The operations of the second stage of the famous campaign of 1796
    were as rapid and as completely successful. On the 8th May Bonaparte
    crossed the river Po by skilfully misleading the Austrians as to his
    intentions, and on 10th May he forced the passage of the Adda at Lodi,
    where he won one of his most famous victories. The Austrian General
    Beaulieu felt himself incapable of holding the lines of the other
    rivers, and fled into the Tyrol. Bonaparte first occupied Milan, and
    then forced the Dukes of Parma and of Modena to submit to his demands,
    and to send ambassadors to treat for peace at Paris. To these petty
    princelets Bonaparte behaved with the utmost arrogance; not satisfied
    with making large requisitions of money and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span> provisions, he selected
    their finest pictures and works of art, and directed them to be sent
    to Paris. Far more important, from his spiritual position, though not
    of greater military strength, was the Pope. The French armies occupied
    the Legations of Ferrara and Bologna, and Bonaparte then threatened
    to march on Rome. In terror Pope Pius <span class="smcap">VI.</span> concluded, on the
    24th June 1796, an armistice at Foligno, by which he abandoned Ancona,
    and promised to send to Paris the large sum of 20,000,000 livres, with
    many manuscripts and works of art. The conquest of Italy revealed to
    Europe the French Republic in a new light. It showed the monarchs,
    and especially the rulers of little states, that the revolutionary
    propaganda which they had hated and dreaded so much had given way to
    an even more dangerous military policy, directed by a victorious and
    ambitious general.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Campaign in Italy. Third Stage.</div>

  <p>But Austria was not going to be driven out of Italy by a single
    campaign. The beaten army of Beaulieu was reorganised by General
    Melas, and reinforced by 30,000 picked men from the Rhine. This army,
    amounting in all to 70,000 men, was placed under the command of Marshal
    Würmser, who, at the end of July, debouched from the Tyrol and invaded
    Italy by the two sides of Lake Garda. Bonaparte, whose army did not
    exceed 40,000 men, broke up the siege of Mantua which he had formed,
    and utterly defeated the Austrians in the great battle of Castiglione
    on 5th August 1796. Würmser fell back, but in September, the following
    month, he invaded Italy by the valley of the Brenta, and threw himself
    into Mantua. Bonaparte, now considering himself for a time freed from
    the danger of another Austrian attack, made an effort to reconstitute
    Northern Italy. Several of the cities, notably Modena, Bologna, and
    Ferrara, had declared themselves republics, but Bonaparte could see
    no advantage in little republics, and summoned a general assembly of
    deputies from the whole of Lombardy to meet at Milan. This assembly was
    disposed to form a Lombard Republic, but before it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span> could complete its
    deliberations Bonaparte had to fight another Austrian army.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Campaign in Italy. Fourth Stage.</div>

  <p>The Austrians, disgusted and surprised by these successive defeats,
    prepared to make a great effort. For the first time, the Emperor
    appealed directly to the patriotism of the people, and more especially
    of the nobility. A new army was equipped, which, if not so numerous,
    was more enthusiastic than the former armies, and was placed under
    the command of General Alvinzi. Bonaparte had received few or no
    reinforcements, and felt himself unable to face an army of 60,000 men.
    He waited, therefore, patiently in his headquarters at Verona while
    Alvinzi advanced slowly down the Brenta. Having learnt experience
    from their former defeats, the Austrians were in no hurry to come
    to blows, even with the small French army in front of them. Alvinzi
    entrenched himself in a formidable position on the heights of Caldiero,
    and repulsed a French attack upon the 12th of November. Another such
    check meant the ruin of the French army. Bonaparte decided to turn
    the position. Advancing along the causeway through the marshes upon
    Alvinzi’s left, he fought the celebrated battle of Arcola on the 16th
    of November, and Alvinzi, finding his position untenable, retreated
    into the Tyrol.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Campaign in Italy. Fifth Stage.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Treaty of Tolentino. Feb. 19, 1797.</div>

  <p>Even yet the Austrians were not finally discouraged. Würmser held out
    in Mantua; the Pope, incited by the Court of Vienna, did not observe
    the Armistice of Foligno, and determined to raise the Italian populace
    against the French; and it was resolved to make a final effort. In
    the depth of winter Alvinzi advanced down the eastern shore of Lake
    Garda, but was stopped and utterly defeated at Rivoli on the 14th
    January 1797. Provera, who had endeavoured to relieve Würmser by the
    Brenta, while Alvinzi occupied the main French army at Rivoli, was also
    defeated, and on 2d February 1797 Mantua surrendered. These successive
    blows destroyed the military power of Austria in Italy, and Bonaparte
    began to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span> plans for invading Austria itself. But before he started
    it was necessary to establish peace behind him. The behaviour of the
    Pope showed the general that His Holiness could not be trusted, and it
    was only under the pressure of a French advance upon Rome that Pius
    <span class="smcap">VI.</span> signed a treaty of peace with the French at Tolentino on
    19th February 1797. By this treaty Bonaparte’s lines of communication
    were secured; the people of Lombardy were his enthusiastic admirers,
    and everything promised a speedy and successful advance upon Vienna.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Campaign in Germany, 1796.</div>

  <p>As Reubell had stated to the Prussian ambassador, the chief effort of
    the French armies was directed in the year 1796 against the Austrians
    in Italy. But the operations in Germany were nevertheless of extreme
    importance; not on account of what was achieved, but because of
    their effect on the policy of the Princes of the Empire. Carnot,
    who was left in entire charge of military affairs by the Directory,
    combined a skilful plan of campaign. He directed the Army of the
    Rhine-and-Moselle, now under the command of Moreau, and the Army of
    the Sambre-and-Meuse, still under the command of Jourdan, to make a
    simultaneous advance into the heart of Germany, and to unite their
    forces upon the Danube. The generals were sufficiently able, and the
    troops sufficiently experienced in war, to carry out this movement; but
    at the head of the Austrians, for the first time since the outbreak
    of the war, there appeared a general of real military genius. The
    Archduke Charles, the third son of the Emperor Leopold, and the brother
    of the reigning Emperor, Francis <span class="smcap">II.</span>, was only a young man,
    but he proved himself to be a profound strategist. On the 1st June
    1796 he announced to the French generals that the armistice, which
    had lasted six months, was at an end. Jourdan at once advanced from
    Düsseldorf, and after taking Frankfort and Würtzburg invaded Franconia.
    The Archduke Charles immediately opposed him with his whole army, and
    Jourdan had to fall back after a three weeks’ campaign.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span> Moreau was
    not able to cross the Rhine until 24–25 June 1796. The operation was
    one of extreme difficulty, which was chiefly overcome by the skill
    and gallantry of Desaix. Moreau then proceeded to carry out Carnot’s
    orders; he advanced with great rapidity; he defeated the Prince de
    Condé and his army of <i>émigrés</i> at Ettlingen; he occupied Stuttgart,
    and forced his way into Bavaria, reaching the Danube in the month of
    August. To oppose him the Archduke Charles marched rapidly to the
    south, and Jourdan once more left Düsseldorf and invaded Franconia. The
    Archduke Charles soon understood the intentions of Carnot, and took
    up a central position between the two French armies at Ingolstadt. He
    waited until the French generals had penetrated far from their base of
    operations, and then, leaving but a weak division in front of Moreau,
    he attacked Jourdan in force. The French Army of the Sambre-and-Meuse
    was overcome by the weight of numbers; on the 3d of September it
    was driven from Würtzburg, and on the 20th of September defeated at
    Altenkirchen, where Marceau, one of the most renowned of the young
    generals of the republican period, was killed. Having driven back
    Jourdan, the Archduke Charles turned upon Moreau. That general had
    imprudently continued to advance into Bavaria, and did not perceive
    until late in September the critical position in which he had been
    left by the retreat of Jourdan. When he did perceive it, he extricated
    himself by one of the most famous retreats known in military history.
    For forty days he fell back through a hostile country, with bad roads,
    and offering almost innumerable difficulties from its lofty mountains
    and dense forests, and harassed by the presence of a victorious
    Austrian army attempting to cut off his retreat, and eventually he
    recrossed the Rhine on the 24th of October.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Effects of the Campaign in Germany.</div>

  <p>From a military point of view, apart from the intrinsic interest
    presented by the operations of the armies, the chief importance of
    the campaign of 1796 in Germany lay in the fact that it occupied a
    considerable force of Austrian troops,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span> which were thus prevented from
    being sent as reinforcements to the Austrian army in Italy. From the
    diplomatic point of view, the campaign had results almost rivalling
    those achieved by Bonaparte in Italy. The advance of the French threw
    the states of Southern Germany into the hands of Prussia. They felt
    a natural sentiment of jealousy at perceiving the states of Northern
    Germany escaping the horrors of war, owing to the line of demarcation
    established by the Treaty of Basle. Many of the smaller states, and at
    least one of the larger states, Saxony, implored the intervention of
    Prussia. Frederick William <span class="smcap">II.</span>, only too glad to pose as the
    guardian of the Empire, made use of all his influence to induce the
    French Directory to consent to the further extension of the line of
    demarcation. Reubell, the Director who took charge of foreign policy,
    was possessed by the idea that Prussia and France were natural allies,
    and induced the Directory to meet the views of Frederick William
    <span class="smcap">II.</span>; but in return he demanded that Prussia should enter into
    an offensive and defensive alliance with the French Republic. The
    King of Prussia, in his hatred of Jacobin principles, was inclined
    to reject this proposal, but his ministers, notably Haugwitz and
    Alvensleben, persuaded him that it was impossible to refuse entirely.
    A compromise was arranged, and on 5th August 1796 a secret supplement
    to the Treaty of Basle was signed between France and Prussia. By this
    secret convention Prussia definitely promised to recognise the limits
    of the Rhine for the French Republic, and in return France guaranteed
    that at a general peace not only the King of Prussia should receive
    compensation for the territories he surrendered, by the cession of some
    ecclesiastical states, but also that his brother-in-law, the Prince of
    Orange, should receive a sovereignty in Germany, to make up for the
    loss of the Stadtholderate in Holland. It proved impossible to extend
    the line of demarcation to the southern states of Germany as long as
    the Austrian army of the Archduke Charles remained there. And therefore
    the petty rulers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span> endeavoured to make peace with France on their own
    account. The Duke of Würtemburg and the Margrave of Baden both opened
    negotiations, and since the Elector of Bavaria had fled into Saxony on
    the advance of Moreau, the Estates of Bavaria signed a treaty of peace
    with the French general at Pfaffenhofen on the 7th September 1796. But
    the successes of the Archduke Charles and the retreat of Moreau put
    an end to these peaceful dispositions. The Elector of Bavaria refused
    to ratify the treaty his Estates had made; the Duke of Würtemburg
    dismissed the minister who had conducted his negotiations; and in spite
    of all the efforts of Prussia, the predominance of Austria continued in
    Southern Germany.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Internal Policy of the Directory, 1796.</div>

  <p>The successes of Bonaparte in Italy, and the operations of the French
    armies in Germany which, though they had ended in retreat, had not been
    discreditable to the generals or soldiers, reacted very favourably upon
    the position of the Directory. The French, as a nation, have always
    been dazzled by military glory, and since the armies of the Directory
    were victorious, they were inclined to look upon the government of
    the Directory as excellent. But military successes did not merely add
    to the reputation of the Directors; by means of them their financial
    difficulties were relieved. The doctrine that invading armies should
    live upon the resources of the invaded countries was a most convenient
    one. Not only did the armies in Italy and Germany maintain themselves
    free of cost to the Directory, but the generals sent large sums of
    money to Paris. It was therefore unnecessary to impose fresh taxes
    or issue more paper money. But the relief of financial distress was
    not the only result of the government of the Directory in 1796; it
    restored internal peace. Hoche, after his defeat of the <i>émigrés</i> at
    Quiberon Bay in 1795, devoted himself to the pacification of Brittany
    and La Vendée. The chief credit due to the Directors is that they gave
    the young general a free hand. While putting down armed insurrection,
    and defeating the Vendéan chiefs whenever they appeared, Hoche used
    the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span> most conciliatory measures towards individuals. His policy, as he
    himself declared in one of his proclamations, was to make the Republic
    loved. While punishing brigandage severely, he conveniently forgot all
    past offences as long as the offenders occupied themselves peacefully;
    and on the 15th of July 1796 the Directory was able to announce to
    the Legislature that the whole of France was at peace. In truth, all
    political disturbances were at an end. The majority of the French
    people frankly accepted the Republic, and seemed to care very little
    what was the actual form of the republican government. But though
    political disturbances were over, the troubled times through which
    France had passed had left only too much scope for private animosity.
    In the south armed bands, resembling the Companies of Jehu of 1795,
    pretended to be acting for the defence of religion, when they were
    really moved by desire of plunder and booty. In the centre the pretext
    of religion was not alleged, but armed bands of brigands collected
    in the forests and the mountains, and, like the banditti in Italy,
    pillaged travellers on the high roads, and held whole villages to
    ransom. These evils steadily diminished with the consistent enforcement
    of the law, but it was some years before France became absolutely safe
    for travellers. Of less importance were the insurrections fomented
    by the extreme democratic party. Democracy was discredited by the
    recollection of the Reign of Terror, and the plot of Babeuf in May,
    and an attack on the camp at Grenelle in November 1796, were easily
    suppressed.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">First changes in the Directory and the Legislature, 1797.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Changes in the Ministry.</div>

  <p>By the terms of the Constitution of the Year <span class="smcap">III.</span> no change in
    the Directory or the Legislature was to be made until February 1797.
    By this arrangement a period of consistent government was secured. The
    Directors, on the whole, acted harmoniously together. The pre-eminence
    of Reubell and Carnot was generally recognised; Barras occupied
    himself chiefly with his pleasures; Revellière-Lépeaux was engaged in
    establishing his new religion of Theo-philanthropy, which made some
    converts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span> in the towns, but found no followers in the villages; and
    Letourneur simply acted as Carnot’s lieutenant. In the Legislature
    the chief leaders, such as Sieyès, Cambacérès, and Boissy-d’Anglas,
    showed occasionally their jealousy of their former colleagues in the
    Convention; but, on the whole, they did not try to interfere with their
    measures. The only heated debates which took place in the Council of
    Five Hundred were on the nature of the disturbances in the south of
    France. These were roundly asserted by the opposing parties to be
    caused by intrigues of priests, or by intrigues of Jacobins. Fréron,
    who had been sent by the Directory to settle these troubles, was very
    violently attacked, and with difficulty exculpated himself from the
    charge of political partisanship. But, on the whole, the debates in
    both branches of the Legislature were very tame. Nevertheless there
    appeared, during 1796, the germ of what in 1797 was known as the
    Clichian party, so called from its meeting at the Club de Clichy. This
    party was not openly royalist, but the chiefs of the French <i>émigrés</i>,
    supported by the funds supplied by Wickham, believed they could use
    it to serve their own purposes, as they had made use of the agitators
    in the Paris Sections in 1795. In the ministry no changes of great
    importance were made in 1796; Ramel, the former colleague of Cambon
    in the Financial Committee of the Convention, replaced Faypoult as
    Minister of the Finances; and Pétiet, a former commissary-general, was
    appointed Minister of War in succession to Aubert-Dubayet. Of more
    importance was the creation of a seventh ministry, of General Police,
    in January 1796, for it was an evidence of a new spirit, and the first
    symptom of the elaborate scheme for muzzling public opinion, which was
    developed to its height by Fouché at a later date. Merlin of Douai
    left the Ministry of the Interior for three months to organise the new
    department, and was succeeded in April 1796 by Cochon de Lapparent, a
    former member of the Convention.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Treaty of San Ildefonso. 19th Aug. 1796.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Battle of St. Vincent.</div>

  <p>It has been said that the Directors endeavoured in vain to form
    an offensive and defensive alliance with Prussia. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span> were more
    successful with regard to Spain. The power of Godoy, who for the
    negotiations at Basle had been created Prince of the Peace, rose to its
    height. General Pérignon, who had been sent as ambassador to Madrid by
    the Directory, skilfully flattered the vanity of the new prince, and,
    to the astonishment of all Europe, an offensive and defensive alliance
    was signed between the French Republic and the ancient Bourbon monarchy
    of Spain at San Ildefonso, on the 19th of August 1796, by which Spain
    agreed to declare war against England, and the French promised to
    assist in the conquest of Portugal, which was to be divided between
    the two allies. From a military point of view the alliance with Spain
    did not yield any advantage to France, but from a naval standpoint
    it proved of incalculable value. The English were obliged to abandon
    Corsica, their only foothold in the Mediterranean, and to concentrate
    their fleet at Gibraltar. The Spanish navy, to which much attention had
    been paid throughout the eighteenth century, had certainly improved,
    and, united with a few French men-of-war, far outnumbered the English
    Mediterranean Fleet. This was the year of the great English naval
    mutiny at the Nore, and the profound discontent which possessed the
    English sailors was equally perceptible at Gibraltar. But fortunately
    the English admiral, Sir John Jervis, was a man of singular ability,
    who understood the English sailor perfectly. He showed no mercy to
    ringleaders, but maintained discipline, and even made it popular
    by looking after the men’s food, and appealing to their patriotic
    feelings. He understood that, on the eve of a battle, the sailors would
    cease their disaffection. Accordingly he kept at sea for several months
    after the junction of the French and Spanish fleets, announcing his
    intention to offer battle; and when discipline was restored he utterly
    defeated the French and Spaniards off Cape St. Vincent, on the 14th of
    February 1797. By this victory, in which Nelson greatly distinguished
    himself, the Spanish fleet was practically destroyed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span> for offensive
    purposes, and the high hopes that the Directory had built on the naval
    assistance of Spain were frustrated. England had promptly, as in former
    days, come to the help of Portugal, and sent an army under the Hon.
    Sir Charles Stuart to defend the country, and a general, the Prince of
    Waldeck, to reorganise the Portuguese army.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Directory and England.</div>

  <p>While the Directory made an alliance with Spain, and hoped to make one
    with Prussia, its sentiments of hostility towards England remained
    undiminished. It had been expected in France that the conquest of
    Holland and the formation of the Batavian Republic, in close alliance
    with the French Republic, would have struck a more serious blow at
    the prosperity of England than it had really done. As a matter of
    fact, the loss of Holland proved but a slight commercial disaster; the
    commerce of the North of Europe, which passed through English hands,
    merely moved from Amsterdam to Hamburg, and the English merchants
    suffered little. From a naval point of view, the French possession
    of Holland made it necessary for England to set on foot a powerful
    fleet to watch the Dutch navy in the Texel, while she also had to
    maintain a fleet blockading the French port of Brest in addition to
    her Mediterranean fleet. The English government was more profoundly
    affected by Bonaparte’s victories in Italy than by the loss of Holland.
    In November 1796 Lord Malmesbury was sent to Paris to discuss the bases
    of a peace. He began to negotiate for the restoration of the <i>status
      quo ante bellum</i>, and demanded the surrender of Belgium to the Emperor.
    Such terms were ridiculous; the French Directors, even had they wished,
    would not have dared to withdraw from their policy of making the Rhine
    the frontier of France. The diplomatic habitudes of Lord Malmesbury
    were regarded by the Directors as proofs of his double-dealing, and
    he was abruptly ordered to leave Paris on the 20th December 1796.
    There was little real expectation of peace on either side. At the
    very time Lord Malmesbury was in Paris the Directory was preparing
    a naval expedition in Brest harbour.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span> It was announced that the
    expedition was intended for the West Indies, and it was placed under
    the command of Hoche. On the 16th of December it set sail for Bantry
    Bay, for the Directory had really recurred to the old French idea of
    attacking England through Ireland. But a terrible storm scattered the
    French Fleet, and only two or three ships reached Bantry Bay, and they
    returned to France without effecting a landing.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Death of Catherine of Russia. Nov. 17, 1796.</div>

  <p>Though the history of Europe during the year 1796 is chiefly bound up
    in the policy and military achievements of France, the close of the
    year witnessed the disappearance of the greatest monarch of Eastern
    Europe. On the 17th November 1796, Catherine of Russia died. The
    importance of her reign belongs to the period prior to the French
    Revolution, and her attitude towards the series of events grouped under
    that title, was chiefly dictated by the course of events in Poland. She
    was succeeded on the throne of Russia by her son, the Emperor Paul. The
    new monarch soon gave evidence of the aberration of intellect which led
    him into the strange excesses that brought about his assassination.
    His first step in foreign politics was to decline to assist Austria
    with his armies, and he even withdrew a Russian fleet which his mother
    had recently sent to the assistance of England. In conversation he
    expressed his detestation of the French as Jacobins, but none the less
    he opened negotiations with the Directory by means of his ambassador at
    Berlin, Kolichev, who communicated freely with the French ambassador
    Caillard.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Bonaparte’s Campaign of 1797.</div>

  <p>In the commencement of the year 1797 the interest of Europe was
    concentrated upon Bonaparte and his army. Being master of Italy he
    now determined to invade the home domains of the House of Austria.
    He begged the Directory to act with energy in Germany in order to
    prevent reinforcements being sent against him. The Emperor recalled
    his brother, the Archduke Charles, from the Rhine, and placed in him
    command of the Austrian army in the Tyrol. On the 16th of March 1797
    Bonaparte<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span> forced the passage of Tagliamento. Joubert, who was acting
    independently in the district of Friuli, made his way by that route
    into the Tyrol, and joined his general-in-chief at Klagenfurt on the
    13th of March. With the combined army Bonaparte pursued the Austrians.
    He defeated the Archduke Charles at Neumarkt and Unzmarkt, and on 7th
    April he entered Leoben. The Archduke Charles felt it impossible to
    oppose the French longer, and on the 17th of April 1797 preliminaries
    of peace were signed at Leoben.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Campaign of 1797 in Germany.</div>

  <p>Simultaneously with Bonaparte’s advance the Armies of the
    Rhine-and-Moselle under Moreau, and of the Sambre-and-Meuse under
    Hoche, were set in motion. The latter advanced from Düsseldorf,
    defeated the Austrians in five engagements, took Wetzlar, and was
    already marching on Giessen in Hanover when his progress was stopped by
    the news of the signature of the Preliminaries of Leoben. Moreau, on
    his side, had not been able to cross the Rhine until 20th April, and
    had made no further offensive movement, when he was ordered to cease
    operations.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Preliminaries of Leoben. April 17, 1797.</div>

  <p>By the Preliminaries of Leoben the war between France and Austria,
    which had lasted without intermission for five years, came to a
    termination. By the Convention signed at that place, Austria agreed
    that the Rhine should be recognised as the frontier of France, which
    involved the cession of Belgium. In Italy the Emperor promised to give
    up the Milanese, and to receive Venice in compensation. These were
    the territorial bases agreed to, and General Bonaparte was intrusted
    by the Directory with the task of concluding a definitive peace with
    Austria. But this Convention only bound Francis <span class="smcap">II.</span> as head of
    the House of Hapsburg, not as Emperor. It was therefore agreed that a
    congress should be held at Rastadt, at which terms of peace should be
    arranged between the French Republic and the Empire. The Preliminaries
    of Leoben crowned Bonaparte’s great victories, and the monarchs of
    Europe quickly recognised that they had no longer to deal with the
    French Republic, but with the young Corsican general.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Elections of 1797 in France.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> the month of May 1797 a new Director and a new third of the
    Legislature were, in accordance with the Constitution of the Year
    <span class="smcap">III.</span>, elected in France. These elections were entirely
    favourable to the Clichian party. This party, which had gradually grown
    up since the dissolution of the Convention, and took its name from
    the Club de Clichy, was led by men of very considerable ability. The
    sentiment which united them was a loathing of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span> the memory of the Reign
    of Terror and a desire to expel from power those who had taken part in
    it. This sentiment was very general in France, and the new legislators
    returned to the Council of Ancients and the Council of Five Hundred
    were, with but few exceptions, men who had not sat in the Convention.
    Many of them were former members of the Constituent and Legislative
    Assemblies, and had a considerable knowledge of parliamentary tactics.
    Foremost among this group was Barbé-Marbois, who had, under the Bourbon
    monarchy, been intendant of San Domingo, but the deputy belonging to it
    who attracted most attention was General Pichegru. The first success
    of the Clichian party was won in the election of the new Director.
    The retiring Director on whom the lot had fallen was Letourneur, and
    to fill his place was chosen Barthélemy, a former marquis, and the
    diplomatist who had negotiated the Treaties of Basle. This election was
    very significant. It seemed to presage a consistent peace policy. It
    afforded a guarantee that the proscription of the nobles of the <i>ancien
      régime</i> was to be ended.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Policy of the Clichians.</div>

  <p>In foreign policy it was indeed the aim of the Clichians to bring
    about a universal peace. Their home policy was neither so definite
    nor so logical. In their hatred of the Terrorists there can be no
    doubt that the wiser heads among the Clichians desired a return to a
    monarchical government. Pichegru and the more self-seeking among them
    thought that they could obtain money and power by a new revolution.
    Never were the prospects of a counter-revolution more promising. The
    Clichians, recognising the impossibility of restoring the Bourbon
    Monarchy in its former authority, were in favour of a constitutional,
    limited monarchy after the English pattern. But Louis <span class="smcap">XVIII.</span>,
    and the Comte d’Artois, buoyed up by the hopes of the <i>émigrés</i>
    refused to make the slightest concession; they would not acknowledge
    the Constitution of 1791; they would not even promise to consent to
    the slightest limitation of the old monarchical power. Under these
    circumstances the Clichians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span> had to look for a king elsewhere. A few,
    among whom may possibly be counted Pichegru, were ready to accept
    Louis <span class="smcap">XVIII.</span> on his own terms. A larger party were in favour
    of the Duke of Orleans, son of Philippe Égalité, and, in the future,
    King of the French as Louis Philippe. Others favoured the accession
    of a Prussian prince, and negotiations were opened at Berlin to see
    whether Prince Francis, the nephew of Frederick William <span class="smcap">II.</span>,
    would accept the throne. With such divisions of opinion, there was no
    doubt that the internal policy of the Clichians, even though backed by
    large subsidies from England, which passed to them through Switzerland,
    was certain to bring about no result. Nor was their peace policy more
    likely to succeed. The wars of the French Republic had organised a body
    of valiant and experienced soldiers whose trade was war, and to whom
    the idea of peace was repugnant. Both Bonaparte and Hoche, the two
    greatest generals of the Directory, naturally looked with suspicion and
    dislike upon the policy of the Clichians.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Struggle between the Directory and the Clichians.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Negotiations for Peace between England and the Directory.</div>

  <p>It need hardly be said that the attitude of the Clichians was one of
    open hostility to the four original Directors. Their one adherent
    in the Directory, Barthélemy, proved to be a very weak support, and
    his brother Directors soon saw that it was unnecessary to trouble
    themselves about him. The four remaining original Directors were
    united in their dislike of the new theories, and also as regicides
    had reason to fear their success. A severe struggle was therefore
    imminent between the majority of the Legislature and of the Executive.
    A crisis had arisen which tested the political theories which had
    found their expression in the Constitution of the Year <span class="smcap">III.</span>
    The Legislature endeavoured to encroach upon the authority of the
    Directory; the Directors refused to yield one jot of their power. The
    first active measure of hostility in the Councils was an attack upon
    the Foreign Minister, Charles Delacroix. Pitt had decided to make
    a second attempt to bring about peace between England and France,
    though without much expectation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span> of its success, and a conference was
    opened at Lille on the 4th July 1797, at which Lord Malmesbury was
    present as the English plenipotentiary. He presented, on behalf of
    England, almost the same demands as had been rejected in the previous
    December, and the negotiations were speedily broken off. Using this as
    a pretext, the hostile majority in the Council of Ancients and Council
    of Five Hundred accused the Directors of not sincerely wishing for
    peace, and threw the chief blame for the rupture of the conference on
    their minister, Delacroix. The Directory yielded. Charles Delacroix
    was sent as ambassador to Holland, and was succeeded as Foreign
    Minister by Talleyrand. This skilful and subtle diplomatist saw that
    the rivalry between the two powers in the State must lead to an open
    rupture. He sided strongly with the Directors; he communicated with
    Hoche and Bonaparte, and there can be little doubt that he was one of
    the principal, if not the principal, author of the <i>coup d’état</i> or
    revolution which followed. The dismissal of Delacroix was perhaps the
    most important episode; but the other ministers were likewise violently
    attacked by the Councils, and in addition to the Foreign Office every
    department of State, except the ministries of Finance and Justice,
    changed hands in July 1797. François de Neufchâteau became Minister
    of the Interior, General Schérer Minister for War, Pleville de Peley
    Minister of the Marine, and Lenoir-Laroche, who was succeeded in a few
    days by Sotin de la Coindière, Minister of Police.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Revolution of 18th Fructidor. (4th September 1797.)</div>

  <p>The revolution of the 18th Fructidor was one which created but little
    interest among the people of France. It was the result of an intrinsic
    weakness in the Constitution, not of a popular movement. Two co-equal
    powers can never exist in the government of a State: when a collision
    takes place one must be overthrown. In their measures for overthrowing
    or muzzling the leaders of the opposition in the Legislature, the four
    senior Directors could not agree. Carnot, the greatest of them all,
    disliked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span> any interference with the Constitution, and looked upon
    the employment of force as likely to lead to great disasters. The
    other original Directors, Barras, Reubell, and Revellière-Lépeaux,
    were, however, perfectly agreed. They were determined to use the
    regular troops that formed the garrison of Paris; Hoche, from Holland,
    sent them a sum of money; and Bonaparte instructed one of his best
    generals, Augereau, to act according to their orders. Accordingly, on
    the morning of the 18th Fructidor (4th September 1797) fifty-five of
    the leaders of the Clichian party in the Legislature, including both
    Barbé-Marbois and Pichegru, were arrested, and were at once deported,
    with the ex-minister of Police, Cochon de Lapparent, and several other
    individuals, without trial, to Cayenne and Sinnamari. The same harsh
    measures were not taken with regard to the two dissentient Directors,
    Carnot and Barthélemy, who were given every facility for escaping from
    France. This revolution was carried out without the shedding of a
    single drop of blood, and the success of the Directors was acquiesced
    in by the people of France.</p>

  <p>Merlin of Douai, the great jurist and statesman, and François de
    Neufchâteau, a dramatist and former member of the Legislative
    Assembly, were elected as the new Directors in the place of Carnot and
    Barthélemy, and were succeeded in the ministries of Justice and the
    Interior by Lambrechts and Letourneur.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Occupation of Venice.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">The Ligurian Republic.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">The Cisalpine Republic.</div>

  <p>After the conclusion of the Preliminaries of Leoben Bonaparte returned
    to Italy and established himself at Montebello, near Milan. He was
    appointed plenipotentiary of the French Republic to conclude a final
    treaty with Austria, but the negotiations lasted for many months.
    During this time the young general was chiefly engaged in settling
    Italy. He first made a terrible example of the city of Verona, where
    the people had risen in revolt during his campaign in the Tyrol, and
    had murdered the wounded French soldiers left in their city. He next
    occupied Venice, and exacted from it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span> a heavy contribution in money.
    Having thus established his power throughout northern Italy, Bonaparte
    began to set up new governments. On the 15th of June 1797 be insisted
    on the dissolution of the ancient government of Genoa, and formed
    that city and the surrounding districts into a new Ligurian Republic.
    Piedmont, by the terms of the Treaty of Cherasco, was left to the
    King of Sardinia, but Bonaparte at once formed Lombardy, Modena,
    Reggio, Bologna, Ferrara, the Romagna, Brescia, and Mantua into one
    State, which he named the Cisalpine Republic. The Constitution of
    this new Republic, which was modelled on the Constitution of the Year
    <span class="smcap">III.</span>, was promulgated on the 9th of July 1797. In these
    measures Bonaparte had carefully avoided any annexations by France. It
    was otherwise with regard to the Ionian Islands, which were ceded to
    the French Republic by Venice. Corfu was occupied on the 28th of June
    1797, and Bonaparte believed that by this cession the French fleet in
    the Mediterranean would be able to close the Adriatic Sea.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Treaty of Campo-Formio. 17th October 1797.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Capture of Mayence. 29th December 1797.</div>

  <p>During the months in which Italy was being thus reconstructed, the
    Austrian plenipotentiary, Cobenzl, was skilfully delaying the signature
    of a definitive treaty between France and Austria. In truth, the
    Austrians, like the English, Thugut, like Pitt, hoped that the Clichian
    party would win the day. The successful <i>coup d’état</i> of 18th of
    Fructidor destroyed his hopes, and on 17th of October 1797 the Treaty
    of Campo-Formio was signed. The bases laid down by the Preliminaries of
    Leoben were generally followed. The frontier of the Rhine for France
    was solemnly recognised. The new arrangements in Italy were also agreed
    to, and to Austria was ceded Venice and all the territories of Venice
    in Istria and Dalmatia and up to the Adige, in compensation for the
    loss of the Milanese. The Emperor also engaged to use his influence
    at the Congress of Rastadt to secure peace between France and the
    Holy Roman Empire. The Treaty of Campo-Formio really<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span> struck a more
    severe blow at the Empire than at the House of Austria. The cession
    of the Rhine frontier to France implied the loss to the Empire of the
    electorates of Trèves, Mayence, and the Palatinate, while it only
    deprived Austria of her mutinous and rebellious subjects in Belgium.
    A secret clause was also added to the Treaty, by which the French
    Republic promised to guarantee the whole of Bavaria to the House of
    Austria, in return for the immediate evacuation of all the fortresses
    which the Austrians occupied upon the Rhine. Immediately upon receiving
    the news of the Treaty of Campo-Formio the Directory equipped a special
    army under the command of General Hatry for the capture of Mayence,
    the only place on the left bank of the Rhine not in the possession of
    France. Deprived of the assistance of Austria, the troops of the Empire
    and of the Elector of Mayence could make but little resistance, and on
    29th of December 1797 Mayence was once more surrendered to the French
    Republic.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Holland. The Batavian Republic.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Battle of Camperdown. 11th October 1797.</div>

  <p>The Batavian Republic, which had been established in 1795 in Holland,
    was also considerably affected by the revolution of 18th Fructidor.
    The Dutch Legislature had been influenced by every current of feeling
    in France, and during the predominance of the Clichians had made no
    real effort to support their French allies. After the conclusion of
    the Convention of Leoben, and the consequent cessation of hostilities
    in Germany, the Directory despatched Hoche to Holland. He there busied
    himself with another effort for his favourite scheme for the invasion
    of England. For this purpose he relied upon the powerful Dutch fleet,
    which was being blockaded by an English squadron under Admiral Duncan
    in the Texel. During the mutiny at the Nore in the summer of 1797
    the position of the blockading English fleet had been very critical,
    and on one occasion it is stated that two English ships were left to
    watch fifteen Dutch. Directly after the revolution of Fructidor, the
    Directors, who did not feel certain of the support of Moreau, removed
    Hoche from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span> Holland and placed him in command of the united Armies
    of the Rhine-and-Moselle and the Sambre-and-Meuse under the title of
    the Army of Germany. Hardly had he taken up his command when the most
    distinguished rival of Bonaparte died on the 18th of September 1797.
    Though deprived of the active superintendence of Hoche, the government
    of the Batavian Republic, under the influence of the vigorous war
    policy of the new Directory, ordered the Dutch fleet to leave the
    Texel. It was met at sea by Admiral Duncan off the dunes or downs
    of Kampe (Camperdown), and entirely defeated after the most hotly
    contested naval battle of the war. The naval policy of the Directory
    had thus resulted in the destruction of the Spanish fleet in the battle
    of Cape St. Vincent and of the Dutch fleet in the battle of Camperdown.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Bonaparte in Paris.</div>

  <p>On the 5th of December 1797 General Bonaparte arrived in Paris. The
    death of Hoche had left him without a rival, and the revolution of the
    18th of Fructidor had been so entirely the result of the assistance
    of the army that its greatest general was practically the master of
    the political situation. The Directors received him with transports
    of enthusiasm and gave him a public reception, but, nevertheless,
    they were overawed by the extent of his reputation and afraid that he
    might attempt to take an active part in politics. He was appointed to
    the command of the Army of the Interior, which was intended for the
    invasion of England. Bonaparte, like Hoche, sincerely wished that such
    an invasion should be effected, but he understood the extraordinary
    difficulty inherent in any attempt to transport an army across the
    Channel in the presence of a powerful fleet. He therefore advised the
    Directory that it would be wiser not to attack England directly, but to
    make an effort to overthrow her power in Asia. It seemed to him more
    practicable to invade India than to invade England. His imagination
    was stirred by the conception of an expedition to the East, and the
    Directory was only too glad to remove from France for a time its most
    able and ambitious general.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Expedition to Egypt. 1798.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Battle of the Nile. 1st August.</div>

  <p>On the 9th of May 1798 Bonaparte left Toulon at the head of a picked
    force of his veterans of Italy, and accompanied not only by his
    favourite generals, but also by some of the leading savants and men
    of letters of France. On the 9th of June the fleet reached Malta, and
    on the 12th the Knights of St. John of the Hospital, who had held
    the island ever since the Middle Ages, surrendered it to the French
    general. Leaving a garrison in Malta, Bonaparte then proceeded to
    Egypt. He disembarked in front of Alexandria on the 1st of July, and
    upon the 4th he occupied that city. He then advanced on Cairo, and
    on the 21st of July he defeated the Mamelukes at the Battle of the
    Pyramids, and on the 24th he occupied Cairo. The English fleet in the
    Mediterranean, under the command of Nelson, had been intended to stop
    the expedition to Egypt, but it had been misdirected, and was unable
    to prevent the disembarkation of the French forces. On the 1st of
    August, however, Nelson appeared before Alexandria, and in the battle
    of Aboukir Bay, generally known as the Battle of the Nile, he destroyed
    the French fleet. This victory entirely cut off Bonaparte and his army
    from France. The English held the Mediterranean, and for many months
    prevented the despatch of either news or reinforcements. In November
    they strengthened their position in the great south European sea by the
    occupation of Minorca by an army under the Hon. Sir Charles Stuart, and
    in 1800 the French garrison in Malta surrendered to General Pigot and
    Captain Sir Alexander Ball.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Internal Policy of the Directory.</div>

  <p>Before Bonaparte left Paris the time had come round for the election
    of a new Director. The lot fell upon François de Neufchâteau to
    retire, and his place was filled by Treilhard, a former member of the
    Constituent Assembly and of the Convention. Treilhard had been himself
    one of the leading Thermidorians, and since the close of the Convention
    he had been employed first as Minister in Holland and then as one of
    the French plenipotentiaries at the Congress of Rastadt. There is
    little doubt that Sieyès<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span> might have entered the Directory had he so
    wished, but he preferred to act in a different capacity. François
    de Neufchâteau at once returned to his former office of Minister of
    the Interior, and the only other alteration in the ministry was the
    appointment of Admiral Bruix to be Minister of Marine. The Directory,
    inspired by its victory on the 18th of Fructidor, did not hesitate to
    infringe the terms of the Constitution of the Year <span class="smcap">III.</span> The
    Royalists or Clichians had not dared to appear at the elections to
    the Councils in 1798, and the democrats had been able to elect whom
    they wished. But the Directors did not intend to be subject to the
    democrats any more than to the Clichians, and without the slightest
    show of legality they quashed many of the elections to the Councils
    and gave the vacant seats to their own nominees. This disregard of the
    law was also shown in other branches of the internal policy of the
    Directory. The Directors, in spite of the Constitution, interfered with
    the finances, and, by the advice of Ramel, followed Cambon’s example of
    declaring a partial bankruptcy. This, however, had but little effect in
    France, for, owing to the depreciation in the value of the government
    paper money, very little interest was expected by the creditors of the
    State. In purely internal administration the weariness of the French
    people of political disturbances enabled the agents of the Directory
    to maintain the public peace without difficulty. The lack of capital
    in the country was compensated by the fact that the government was
    the only great employer of labour, and the spoils of the conquered
    countries enabled it to pay the workmen sufficiently. It seems
    surprising that this bankrupt government should have been acknowledged
    without opposition throughout France, but the cause is to be found in
    the universal attention paid to the course of foreign affairs.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Foreign Policy of the Directory.</div>

  <p>The Peace of Campo-Formio had, as has been shown, left France face to
    face with England, and it was to strike a blow at the power of England
    that Bonaparte proceeded to Egypt. For the same reason the Directory
    carried out the favourite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span> scheme of Hoche, and despatched a force
    to Ireland under General Humbert in August 1798, which was forced to
    surrender to Lord Cornwallis in September. But though the powers of the
    Continent had been compelled to acknowledge the military superiority of
    France, they were only seeking a loophole by which to enter once more
    upon a general war. The departure of Bonaparte seemed to offer them
    a good opportunity, and pretexts were not wanting for the formation
    of a new coalition against France. The English ministry understood
    this attitude of the Continental powers, and their emissaries were
    busy in all the Courts of Europe. The Directors knew of these efforts
    of Pitt and did their best to counteract them. The keynote of the
    French policy was, as it had always been, to make an ally of Prussia.
    For this purpose Sieyès, who, though not in office, was probably the
    most influential man in France, obtained his nomination to a special
    embassy to Berlin. He hoped by mixed measures of conciliation and of
    menace to induce Frederick William <span class="smcap">III.</span> of Prussia, who had
    succeeded his father in November 1797, to enter into an offensive and
    defensive alliance. But that monarch, in spite of the weakness of his
    personal character, had absolutely determined to maintain his father’s
    policy of strict neutrality, and neither the arguments of Sieyès nor
    those of Mr. Thomas Grenville, the brother of the English Foreign
    Minister, could induce him to swerve from it in either direction. The
    efforts of England were crowned with more success at Vienna and St.
    Petersburg. The Emperor Francis, and still more the Austrian people,
    were profoundly disgusted by the triumphs of the French, and flattered
    themselves that their defeats had been due to the genius of Bonaparte
    more than to the valour of the French soldiers. On the conclusion of
    the Treaty of Campo-Formio, Bonaparte had, without consulting the
    Directory, nominated General Bernadotte to be the French Ambassador
    at Vienna. The Austrian people took this appointment as an insult;
    Bernadotte, though well received by the Emperor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span> and his ministers,
    soon found that he was most unpopular in Vienna, and on the 13th of
    April 1798 the Viennese mob collected in front of the French Embassy,
    insulted the ambassador, and tore down the insignia of the French
    Republic. In spite of this insult the Directors did not at once declare
    war against Austria, but it afforded a pretext for dwelling on the
    inborn hatred of the Austrians for the French in their proclamations
    to the French people. Since such was the disposition of the Austrian
    people, it need hardly be said that the English envoy was heartily
    welcomed at Vienna. At St. Petersburg the application of Pitt for armed
    help was favourably received. The Emperor Paul, though already showing
    signs of the brutal insanity which was to lead to his assassination,
    still preserved the prestige of being the heir of the great Catherine.
    His ministers were those of Catherine; his policy was based on hers.
    But whereas Catherine had steadfastly refused to go to war with France,
    Paul showed a decided inclination, which was fostered by his generals,
    to see whether the Russian army would not be more successful than
    the Prussian or the Austrian against the seemingly invincible French
    republicans.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Helvetian Republic. April 1798.</div>

  <p>The French Directory, though recognising that it might have soon to
    contend again with the power of Austria, and for the first time with
    that of Russia, nevertheless roused without any reason fresh enemies
    upon the French frontiers. Its greatest mistake at this period was its
    interference with the affairs of Switzerland. For this interference
    there was no real cause, but the Directors could not resist the
    temptation of inflicting their special form of republic upon the Swiss.
    The organisation of most of the cantons of Switzerland was essentially
    feudal and oligarchical. The government of each canton and of each
    city was in the hands of a very few families, and the people were in
    much the same condition politically, socially, and economically as
    the people of France before the Revolution. The Swiss peasants had
    caught the contagion of revolution from France, and in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span> beginning
    of 1798 the people of the Pays de Vaud rose in insurrection against
    the authority of the Canton of Berne. This rising was followed by
    popular tumults in other cantons, and the peasants everywhere destroyed
    the signs of the feudal system and declared themselves in favour
    of ‘Liberty—Equality—Fraternity.’ The popular leaders appealed to
    France for help, and a powerful army under the command of General
    Brune invaded Switzerland. The militia of the cantons was speedily
    routed; Brune occupied Berne and sent the national treasury to
    Paris, and a freely-elected Constituent Assembly was summoned. This
    assembly proclaimed an Helvetian Republic, one and indivisible, with
    a Directory, two Councils, and Ministers, in imitation of the French,
    the Cisalpine, and the Batavian Republics, to take the place of the old
    Swiss federal constitution. Great reforms were speedily accomplished;
    on the 8th of May 1798 internal customs-houses were abolished, and on
    the 13th of May torture was forbidden in judicial processes; on the
    3d of August marriages between persons of different religions were
    declared legal; and eventually all feudal rights were suppressed.
    Great as were these reforms, they were not entirely acceptable to the
    Swiss people. The mountaineers of Uri, Schweitz and Unterwalden, the
    descendants of the founders of the ancient Swiss liberties, objected
    to be freed under the influence of French bayonets, and the cry of
    national patriotism soon raised an army against the French liberators
    of the peasants. The French troops had to remain perpetually under
    arms, and the Helvetian Republic, in spite of the popular freedom which
    it secured, was hated even by the peasants whom it had relieved. The
    hatred for the French name was increased by the arbitrary conduct,
    and it was asserted by the corrupt behaviour, of Rapinat, the French
    commissioner, who was a near relative of Reubell, the Director. The
    intervention of the Directory had, therefore, in Switzerland, roused
    a people in arms, even though it had been dictated by the best of
    motives.</p>

  <p>When Bonaparte left Italy he had been succeeded in the command of the
    French troops which occupied the frontiers of the Cisalpine Republic by
    General Berthier. This general, desirous of emulating the successes of
    Bonaparte, took the opportunity of the murder of the French ambassador
    at Rome, General Duphot, to occupy the Eternal City. The Pope, Pius
    <span class="smcap">VI.</span>, fled from Rome to the Carthusian monastery at Pisa,
    and the Roman people declared themselves to be once more the Roman
    Republic. Consuls and Tribunes, as in ancient days, were elected;
    the Directory, full of classical recollections, recognised the Roman
    Republic with transports of enthusiasm; and General Berthier took the
    opportunity to send large sums of money to Paris. The King of Naples,
    or to speak more accurately, the King of the Two Sicilies, regarded
    the new republic with anything but favour. Encouraged by English and
    Austrian envoys, and still more by the news of Nelson’s victory at
    the Battle of the Nile, he determined to attack Rome. He placed one
    of the most distinguished of the Austrian generals, Mack, at the head
    of his army, and, without declaring war, occupied Rome on the 29th of
    November 1798. The French troops for the moment had to retire. But
    Championnet, who had succeeded Berthier, quickly concentrated his army,
    and on the 15th of December he reoccupied Rome in force. Championnet
    then took the offensive; he invaded the Neapolitan territory, and he
    quickly conquered all Ferdinand’s dominions in Italy. The King fled
    to Sicily, and in January 1799 the Parthenopean Republic was solemnly
    installed at Naples. The two remaining independent states of Italy
    were also occupied by the French armies. The one of these, Piedmont,
    was conquered without any declaration of war or any pretext by General
    Joubert in November 1798, and King Charles Emmanuel <span class="smcap">IV.</span> fled
    to Sardinia. The other, Tuscany, in spite of the desire of the Grand
    Duke to remain at peace with France, was the next victim, and on the
    25th of March 1799 the French troops occupied Florence.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Law of Conscription. 5th Sept. 1798.</div>

  <p>The occupation of the whole of Italy and of Switzerland did not
    increase the military strength of France; on the contrary, the
    proceedings of the Directory only aroused the most profound disgust
    and fear in Austria, Russia, and England. The Directors felt that a
    far more terrible war than they had yet been engaged in was about to
    break forth, and it may be assumed that, on the eve of hostilities,
    they even regretted the absence of Bonaparte. Enormous numbers of
    soldiers would be necessary in a new war. Trained and experienced
    officers and non-commissioned officers existed, but the difficulty was
    how to fill the ranks. It was no longer possible to have recourse to
    the measures of the Convention, to the <i>levée en masse</i>, and to the
    appeal for volunteers with the cry that the country was in danger. The
    Republic had now become a military power, and the question was how to
    recruit its armies, not how to rouse the whole population. On the 19th
    of Fructidor, Year <span class="smcap">VI.</span> (5th September 1798), the Councils of
    the Ancients and of Five Hundred, on the application of the Directory,
    passed the first Law of Conscription. By this law all Frenchmen between
    the ages of twenty and twenty-five with certain exceptions were
    declared to be subject to military service. They were divided into five
    classes, and one or more classes could be called out by the executive
    authority after receiving the consent of the Legislature. This law is
    the starting-point of the military levies which formed the army of
    Napoleon, and the principle of conscription was thus laid down many
    months before Bonaparte became First Consul.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Outbreak of War. 1799.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Battles of Stockach and Magnano. 25th March and 5th April.</div>

  <p>Mention has been made of the riot at Vienna which caused the departure
    of the French ambassador, Bernadotte. He was not replaced by the
    Directory, and long negotiations took place on the subject of the
    compensation due to the Republic for this insult. But neither party
    was in earnest. Both the French Directory and the Emperor Francis were
    preparing for the contest. The first overt act of war took place at
    the commencement of 1799, when the Austrian troops, under the command
    of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span> Archduke Charles, occupied the passes of the Grisons, and it
    was in this quarter that before war was actually declared the first
    engagements were fought. In Italy General Schérer was attacked at
    Verona by the Austrian General Kray, and in Germany General Jourdan
    fell back into the Black Forest. In both of these quarters many
    skirmishes took place, and eventually on the 25th of March 1799 the
    Archduke Charles defeated Jourdan in a pitched battle at Stockach. A
    few days later, on the 5th of April, Schérer was defeated at Magnano.
    Meanwhile the Congress of Rastadt was still sitting, and Austria was
    nominally at peace with France. The conclusion of a treaty between
    France and the Empire, which was the subject of the deliberations
    at Rastadt, was necessarily a difficult matter to negotiate, for it
    involved nothing less than the entire reconstitution of the Holy
    Roman Empire, a reconstitution which could only be carried out by
    the secularisation of the bishoprics. Eventually, in the month of
    April 1799, after the engagements of Stockach and Magnano, the French
    plenipotentiaries at Rastadt understood that it was hopeless to expect
    to conclude a treaty with the Empire. They therefore asked for their
    passports to France. These passports were refused. As they left Rastadt
    the French plenipotentiaries were attacked by some Austrian hussars;
    two of them, Roberjot and Bonnier-d’Alco, were killed, and the other,
    Jean Debry, left for dead. This odious violation of international law
    and the rights of ambassadors took the place of a formal declaration
    of war, and roused not only the Directory but the French people to the
    most strenuous exertions. Meanwhile the Emperor Paul of Russia declared
    war against France, and ordered three armies to be despatched to the
    scenes of action.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Campaign in Italy. 1799.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Battle of the Trebbia. 17th-19th June.</div>

  <p>The campaign of 1799 was fought out in three localities, in all of
    which the Russians played a most prominent part. In Italy a Russian
    army, under the command of one of the most famous generals in Europe,
    Suvórov, reinforced the Austrians after the battle of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span> Magnano.
    Suvórov forced the passage of the Adda at Cassano on the 27th of
    April, and rapidly drove Moreau, who had succeeded Schérer in command,
    across northern Italy. On the 28th of April Suvórov entered Milan,
    and the Cisalpine Republic at once expired. On the 27th of May he
    entered Turin, and after leaving besieging armies before Mantua and
    Alessandria, shut up the remnants of Moreau’s army in Genoa. But the
    army of Moreau was not the only French army in the Italian Peninsula.
    Several powerful divisions, under the name of the Army of Naples, were
    concentrated in Rome and Naples to support the newly-formed Roman and
    Parthenopean Republics. Macdonald, who had succeeded Championnet in the
    command of this army, rapidly concentrated and threatened to take the
    Austro-Russian army in flank. Suvórov withdrew from Turin and turned
    to his left to meet his new assailant. On the banks of the Trebbia a
    three days’ battle was fought from the 17th to the 19th of June. The
    issue of the battle itself was doubtful, but Macdonald, finding himself
    unsupported by Moreau from Genoa, was obliged to retreat into Tuscany.
    Fearing to be cut off, he then forced his way along the difficult
    passage between the mountains and the sea, and joined Moreau, after
    collecting every French soldier from the garrisons in the south of
    Italy. The retreat of the French was followed by an outburst against
    the Italian republicans.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Death of Pope Pius VI. 29th Aug. 1799.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Battle of Novi. 15th August.</div>

  <p>The Parthenopean Republic was at once overthrown, and King Ferdinand
    of the Two Sicilies wreaked cruel vengeance on his subjects. Pope
    Pius <span class="smcap">VI.</span> had been removed from his retreat near Florence
    to Valence, and the French Directors had some idea of keeping him
    prisoner as a hostage in the same way as Napoleon afterwards imprisoned
    his successor. But the old Pope could not bear the sufferings of his
    imprisonment, and died at Valence on the 29th of August 1799. Rome,
    deprived of the presence of the Pope and the Cardinals, fell under the
    dominion of the Roman nobles, who followed the example of the King of
    the Two Sicilies in persecuting the republicans. Meanwhile the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span> French
    Directory appointed General Joubert, who was believed to be the best
    of the former subordinates of Bonaparte, to take command at Genoa of
    the relics of the armies of Moreau and Macdonald. With these soldiers
    he burst out of Genoa to raise the siege of Alessandria, but on the
    15th of August he was utterly defeated by Suvórov at Novi in a great
    battle, in which Joubert himself was killed. In spite of these defeats
    the Directory refused to believe that Italy was lost. A new army was
    formed, and placed under the command of Championnet, who, however,
    was defeated at Genola on the 4th of November by the Austrians, under
    Melas, and driven back into France.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Campaign in Switzerland. 1799.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Battle of Zurich. 26th Sept.</div>

  <p>While Suvórov was conquering Italy and destroying the recollection
    of the victories of Bonaparte in that country, Masséna, who was in
    command of the French army in Switzerland, was engaged in a most
    difficult task. The Archduke Charles, who also had under his command a
    Russian army under Korsakov, forced his way slowly into Switzerland,
    driving the French before him, and in August 1799 left Korsakov in
    command at Zurich. The Archduke was then ordered to take the bulk of
    his army to the Rhine in order to invade France. Korsakov, abandoned
    to his own resources, showed himself far inferior in military ability
    to Suvórov. Masséna, with singular boldness, refused to remain on the
    defensive, and on the 26th of September drove the Russians out of
    Zurich. His victory was won just in time, for Suvórov, after defeating
    Joubert at Novi, had determined, in spite of the terrible weather,
    to cross the Alps. It was on the 24th of September, two days before
    Masséna’s victory at Zurich, that the main Russian army arrived at the
    summit of the St. Gothard Pass. General Lecourbe, one of the finest
    mountain generals of his day, occupied the St. Gothard, and with a few
    battalions kept the whole Russian army at bay. Suvórov nevertheless
    persevered and hoped to turn Masséna’s flank. But it was several weeks
    before he could reach the village of Altdorf. Being unable to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span> find
    boats to cross the lake, he had now to retreat, and when he reached
    the Grisons his army was practically destroyed by starvation and the
    stress of the weather. Masséna, thus relieved of his most formidable
    enemies, took possession of Constance, and by threatening the flank of
    the Archduke Charles forced the main Austrian army to fall back to the
    Danube.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Campaign in Holland. 1799.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Battles of Bergen.</div>

  <p>The third campaign of 1799 was fought in Holland. In this quarter it
    had been arranged that the English and Russians were to act in concert.
    On the 27th of August the English fleet had successfully reached the
    Dutch coast, and had captured the relics of the Dutch fleet, defeated
    at Camperdown, in the Texel. After this operation an English army,
    under the Duke of York, and a Russian army, under General Hermann,
    disembarked at the Helder. General Brune was hurriedly despatched to
    take command of the few French troops in Holland, and co-operated
    with the army of the Batavian Republic under General Janssens. The
    campaign consisted of a succession of fierce but indecisive battles
    in the neighbourhood of Bergen. The English and Russians did not act
    harmoniously together; the country was unsuited for field operations;
    and supplies were not adequately provided. As a result of the
    operations, though he had not been really defeated, the Duke of York
    signed the Convention of Alkmaar on the 18th October, by which he
    agreed to surrender all prisoners on being allowed to evacuate Holland.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Results of the Campaigns.</div>

  <p>The results of the campaigns of 1799 were decidedly favourable to
    France. Though Italy was lost, and more than one French army had been
    defeated, the victories of Masséna and of Brune more than compensated
    for these disasters. Not only had France not been invaded, but she had
    been able to retain her position in Switzerland and in Holland, and
    to hold the whole of the right bank of the Rhine. England, in spite
    of the Convention of Alkmaar, could point to the victory of the Nile
    and the capture of the Dutch fleet in the Texel as real successes,
    and Pitt and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span> Grenville did not despair of ultimate victory. The King
    of Prussia, who, when the affairs of France seemed to be desperate,
    had begun to assume an attitude of opposition, and demanded the
    evacuation of the Prussian provinces on the Rhine, speedily repented
    of his indiscretion, and made excuses for his behaviour. The Austrian
    ministers evinced no desire to continue the war; they resented the
    high-handed conduct of Suvórov, and showed themselves more afraid of
    their powerful ally, Russia, than of their declared enemy, France. They
    implored the English government to bring about the withdrawal of the
    Russian troops, and the Emperor Paul was only too glad to comply. The
    retreat of the Russians left Italy practically in the hands of Austria.
    The Grand Duke Ferdinand of Tuscany was restored to his dominions, but
    the King of Sardinia was not recalled, and Piedmont remained in the
    occupation of the Austrian troops. Genoa alone was held by a French
    garrison, which was closely besieged by the Austrians on the land side,
    and blockaded by the English Mediterranean fleet. It was under the
    influence of Austria and under the protection of Austrian troops that
    the Conclave met at Venice in November 1799 to elect a new Pope.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Russia.</div>

  <p>The significant feature of the campaigns of 1799 was the intervention
    of Russia. Mention has been made of the abandonment of the policy of
    the great Catherine by her successor. This change in the attitude
    of Russia was due mainly to the influence of England, but partly
    to the encouragement given by the French Directory to the Poles.
    The restoration of Poland to its place among the nations had long
    been a favourite idea among French republicans. Kosciuszko had been
    enthusiastically welcomed at Paris, and the first of the Polish
    legions which were to do good service under Napoleon was raised by
    Dombrowski in 1797. The Emperor Paul had met this attitude by welcoming
    the pretender Louis <span class="smcap">XVIII.</span> to Russia, where he lent him the
    palace of Mittau and gave him a considerable pension. He also took
    into Russian pay the armed corps of <i>émigrés</i> under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span> the command of
    the Prince de Condé. But fear of French assistance to Poland would not
    alone have induced the Emperor Paul to declare war. He was particularly
    offended by the French occupation of the Ionian Islands and of Malta.
    By the Treaty of Campo-Formio the Ionian Islands had been ceded to
    France, and the Russians regarded this cession as an indication that
    the Directory was going to interfere actively in the affairs of the
    East. The bad impression created by the occupation of the Ionian
    Islands had been increased by the conquest of Malta and the expedition
    to Egypt. Though Russia quite intended to destroy the power of Turkey,
    she had no idea of allowing any western nation to share the spoils. It
    was for this reason that the Emperor Paul accepted the title of Grand
    Master of the Knights of St. John, which the expelled Knights of Malta
    offered to him, and that he occupied the Ionian Islands with a Russian
    force in 1798. The foreign policy of the Emperor was so far popular
    in Russia in that it maintained the sole right of Russia to interfere
    in the East, but it was unpopular in that it seemed by the despatch
    of the armies under Suvórov and Korsakov to bolster up the power of
    Austria. Suvórov and his officers returned to Russia with a feeling of
    respect for their enemies, but with a feeling of intense disgust at the
    behaviour of their allies. Suvórov, indeed, went so far as to accuse
    the Austrians of playing the part of traitors, and the anger of Paul
    was raised to its height by the capture of Ancona, which was delivered
    by a secret compact to the Austrian general in spite of the assistance
    of Russian troops. He was equally angry with England on account of the
    failure of the expedition to Holland. Every thing at the close of 1799
    conduced to make the Emperor Paul seek for a pretext to make peace, if
    not an actual alliance, with the French Republic.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Campaign in Syria. 1799.</div>

  <p>While these important campaigns were being fought out in Europe,
    Bonaparte had not been idle in the East. The Battle of the Pyramids
    had made him master of Egypt, and though cut off by the English fleet
    from communication with France,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span> he remained master of the country.
    His internal administration made him excessively popular among the
    Egyptians. He removed the Turks and Mamelukes from office, and called
    on the Egyptians to govern themselves. But the Turks did not intend
    to lose Egypt without striking another blow, and a powerful army was
    sent for its reconquest. Bonaparte determined to meet this army half
    way, and in February 1799 he advanced into Syria. He speedily reduced
    Palestine and took Jaffa, and then laid siege to the strong fortress of
    Acre. Assisted by the English sailors of Sir Sidney Smith, the garrison
    of Acre made a gallant defence. The Turkish army advancing to its
    relief was defeated by Bonaparte at Mount Tabor on the 16th of April.
    In spite of his victory, he had, nevertheless, to abandon the siege
    of Acre, and on the 20th of May he commenced his retreat to Egypt. He
    there found the position to be extremely critical. The Mamelukes had
    reorganised their army and reoccupied Cairo, and a Turkish army had
    been disembarked by the English fleet at Aboukir. Meanwhile Desaix,
    whom he had left in command in Egypt, had gone up the Nile for the
    conquest of the interior. Bonaparte soon re-established his power; he
    defeated the Mamelukes at Cairo, and drove the Turkish army into the
    sea. At this juncture he heard the news of the events of the campaigns
    in Europe, and, what affected him more, of the course of politics at
    Paris. He determined, therefore, to return to France, and leaving
    Kléber in command in Egypt, he set sail with a few personal friends.
    The ship on which he embarked escaped the English cruisers, and he
    landed at Fréjus on the 9th of October 1799 after a perilous voyage of
    forty-seven days.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Quarrel between the Councils and the Directory.</div>

  <p>The varying issues of the campaigns of 1799 had profoundly affected
    the situation of the Directors, and the disasters in Italy had turned
    the hopes both of the army and of the French people towards Bonaparte.
    At the annual change in the composition of the Directory and the
    Councils which took place in 1799 a considerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span> alteration had been
    made. The new third of the Councils consisted almost entirely of men
    who, without being either Jacobins or Clichians, longed to see the
    establishment of a strong government in order to secure peace. The
    Directory, which had seemed so strong after the revolution of the
    18th of Fructidor, had been considerably weakened by the behaviour
    of the Directors themselves. The election of none but civilians to
    the highest offices in the State was disliked by the army, and the
    characters of the Directors themselves had suffered. Reubell was the
    Director designed by lot to retire in May 1799; he was perhaps the
    ablest and most experienced of them all, but had been discredited by
    the bad conduct of his relative, Rapinat, in Switzerland. Sieyès was
    elected to succeed Reubell. This choice, and the acceptance of Sieyès,
    testified to a new condition of affairs. The former abbé might have
    been a Director on at least two former occasions, in 1795 and 1798, and
    his acceptance at this juncture was very significant. He had failed
    in his embassy to Berlin to induce the new King of Prussia to become
    the active ally of France, and had been convinced by his diplomatic
    experiences that the government of France must become frankly
    military, since the monarchical powers of Europe would not accept the
    possibility of a peaceable French Republic. From an internal point of
    view the acceptance of Sieyès indicated an increase of power for the
    Legislature, of which he was the idol.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Coup d’état of 30th Prairial (18th June 1799).</div>

  <p>The election of Sieyès was followed by a bloodless revolution.
    He maintained that the failure of the Constitution of the Year
    <span class="smcap">III.</span> was due to the usurpation of the functions of the
    Legislature by the Directory, and, therefore, when the Councils
    declared Treilhard and Merlin of Douai to have been illegally chosen
    Directors, and called for the resignation of Revellière-Lépeaux, they
    found a powerful ally in Sieyès. The attacked Directors yielded without
    a struggle, and on 30th Prairial, Year <span class="smcap">VII.</span> (18th June 1799),
    they were replaced by three personal friends of Sieyès, Gohier, Roger
    Ducos, and General Moulin. Barras was thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span> the only member left of
    the original Directory. The Councils, not satisfied with this victory,
    began to usurp the executive functions of the Directory, and a general
    change of ministry took place. The new ministers were Reinhard, Robert
    Lindet, Cambacérès, Quinette, Bernadotte, replaced on 14th September by
    Dubois-Crancé, Fouché, and Bourdon de Vatry, who succeeded Talleyrand
    and his colleagues as Ministers of Foreign Affairs, the Finances,
    Justice, the Interior, War, Police, and the Marine respectively. It is
    worthy of note that four of the new ministers were formerly leading
    members of the Convention. But the administration of the Councils was
    not more effective than that of the Directory, and the news of the
    disembarkation of Bonaparte at Fréjus was received with a feeling of
    general satisfaction throughout France.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Revolution of 18th Brumaire. (9th November 1799.)</div>

  <p>Bonaparte reached Paris on the 16th of October, and his assistance was
    sought by men of all parties. He allied himself with none, but there
    can be little doubt that he took the advice mainly of Talleyrand,
    Fouché, and Sieyès. Nevertheless he did not repulse the leaders of
    the Councils, and to show their attachment for him the Council of
    Five Hundred, on the 22d of October 1799, elected his brother Lucien
    Bonaparte to be their president, and the whole Legislature gave him
    a grand banquet on 6th November. The first stage of the revolution
    of Brumaire was a decree by which the Council of Ancients, or rather
    certain of its members, who had been initiated into the project of
    a <i>coup d’état</i>, taking advantage of a clause in the Constitution
    applicable to circumstances of popular agitation, resolved in the early
    morning of the 18th Brumaire, Year <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> (9th November 1799),
    that the two Councils should leave Paris and meet at Saint-Cloud; and
    the execution of this decree was intrusted to General Bonaparte. In
    the palace of Saint-Cloud it was easy to surround the legislators by a
    body of troops faithful to Bonaparte, since the command of the troops
    in Paris was in the hands of one of his friends, General Lefebvre, who
    was discontented at not having been elected a Director<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span> instead of
    Moulin. Sieyès and Roger Ducos, who were in the plot, at once declared
    their resignations; Barras was induced to acquiesce; and the other two
    Directors were guarded as prisoners in the palace of the Luxembourg
    by General Moreau. On the following morning, the 19th of Brumaire,
    Bonaparte entered the Councils, escorted by soldiers; the Ancients
    listened to him quietly; but the Five Hundred were in a tumult; a
    proposal was made to declare the general and his supporters <i>hors la
      loi</i> or outlaws; and after a stormy scene the deputies were driven from
    the hall by the grenadiers. In the evening a few deputies, who were in
    the secret of the general’s plans, met and decreed the suppression of
    the Directory and the creation of a provisional government, consisting
    of three Consuls. The three men chosen for this office were Bonaparte,
    Sieyès, and Roger Ducos. Commissions were appointed to revise the
    Constitution and to draw up with the Consuls new fundamental laws for
    the Republic. By this revolution Bonaparte practically became ruler of
    France, for Sieyès had no influence with the army, and Roger Ducos no
    influence with anybody. It was a military revolution like that of the
    18th Fructidor; it was a bloodless revolution like that of the 18th
    Fructidor; but it differed in that, instead of establishing the power
    of five men, it established the power of one. And that one man was the
    idol of the army, and generally acknowledged to be the greatest general
    of France. The preponderance of Bonaparte was quickly recognised by
    his colleagues. ‘Who shall preside?’ said Sieyès at the first meeting
    of the provisional Consuls on 20th Brumaire. ‘Do you not see that the
    general is in the chair?’ replied Roger Ducos. And Sieyès, who was
    the chief epigram maker as well as the constitution-monger of the
    Revolution, is said to have summed up the situation with the remark to
    his friends on the same evening: ‘Messieurs, nous avons un maître; il
    sait tout, il peut tout, il veut tout.’</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Constitution of the Year VIII.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> revolution of the 18th of Brumaire had placed supreme power in
    the hands of Bonaparte; that power was speedily legalised and defined
    in the Constitution of the Year <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> The chief political
    problem was once more how to regulate the relation between the
    legislative and executive authorities. The Constitution of 1791, and
    still more that of 1793, had entirely subordinated the executive to
    the legislative authority; the Constitution of the Year <span class="smcap">III.</span>
    (1795) had endeavoured to co-ordinate them; the Constitution of the
    Year <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> (1799) entirely subordinated the legislative to
    the executive. It fell once more to Sieyès, one of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span> principal
    authors of the Constitutions of 1791 and 1795, as Second Provisional
    Consul, to define the new arrangements. His attempt at co-ordinating
    the two powers in the State in 1795 had failed in its operation: as
    was inevitable, the two authorities declined to preserve their legal
    relations to each other. On the 18th of Fructidor, Year <span class="smcap">V.</span>
    (4th September 1797), the executive in the form of the Directory had
    usurped and partially destroyed the power of the Legislature, and
    on the 30th of Prairial, Year <span class="smcap">VII.</span> (18th of June 1799) the
    Legislature had acted in the same way towards the executive. By the
    Constitution of the Year <span class="smcap">VIII.</span>, therefore, the executive power
    was frankly acknowledged to be supreme. In its details it was entirely
    the work of Sieyès, though his main idea—the appointment of a Grand
    Elector who should nominate to fill all offices, but should exercise no
    power—was rejected by Bonaparte. The new Constitution was soon ready;
    it was submitted to the primary assemblies of the people on the 14th
    December 1799, and was accepted by them by 3,011,107 votes against
    1567, and was officially proclaimed on the 24th of December.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Consulate.</div>

  <p>The key-stone of the new Constitution was the Consulate. There were
    to be three Consuls nominated for ten years, but these officials
    were not to be equal in authority, as had been the case with the
    Directors. On the contrary, the First Consul was to be perpetual
    president and perpetual representative of the governing triumvirate.
    All administrative power was placed in his hands, and the Second and
    Third Consuls were little more than his chief assistants. The Consuls
    acting together nominated the Ministers, and also the Council of State,
    which was intended to be at the same time an administrative tribunal of
    appeal, and the originating source in matters of legislation.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Legislature.</div>

  <p>In the work of legislation the Council of State was supplemented by the
    Tribunate and the Legislative Body. All laws prepared by the Council
    of State were first submitted to the Tribunate, which was composed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
    of one hundred members. The Tribunate could neither reject nor amend
    a law, but decided whether to support or oppose the project before
    the Legislative Body. The Legislative Body consisted of three hundred
    deputies chosen by certain electoral assemblies formed by a complicated
    scheme out of the taxpayers of the departments. By this scheme, after
    three series of elections, what was termed a ‘National List’ was drawn
    up. From this national list the Senate chose the members both of the
    Legislative Body and the Tribunate. The Legislative Body alone voted
    the taxes. In legislative matters it played the part of a national
    jury, listening to the arguments for or against brought forward by
    the Tribunate on every project prepared by the Council of State, and
    deciding in every case without discussion. The Legislative Body alone
    could give a project of the Council of State the character of a law.
    The Senate was composed of eighty members nominated for life by the
    Consuls. Its duties were to choose the members of the Tribunate and
    Legislative Body from the National List, and to decide whether any
    law or measure of the government was contrary to the Constitution. If
    it decided that such law or measure was unconstitutional it had the
    authority to annul it.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Internal Policy of the Consulate.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">The Code Napoléon.</div>

  <p>The Consulate was composed of Bonaparte as First Consul, with
    Cambacérès and Le Brun, both famous jurists, as his associates. Their
    policy was one of general reconciliation. The individuals deported
    after the revolution of the 18th of Fructidor were allowed to return
    to France if they had not, like Pichegru, become declared royalists.
    They were even taken into favour; while Carnot was appointed Minister
    of War, Portalis and Barbé-Marbois were nominated to the Council of
    State. The lists of emigration were closed; no longer could persons be
    declared to have emigrated on mere suspicion, and the First Consul, as
    an administrative measure, annulled the decrees excluding relations of
    <i>émigrés</i> and former nobles from filling executive offices. More than
    150,000 <i>émigrés</i> were also allowed to return, mostly priests, who were
    no longer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span> regarded as rebels, and who, whether they had taken the oath
    to observe the Civil Constitution of the Clergy or not, were allowed
    to resume their sacred functions on simply promising to obey the new
    Constitution of the State. The Consulate did even more than this for
    the cause of religion; many churches which had been appropriated
    for civil purposes were restored to their original uses. Brigandage
    was sternly put down, and Bonaparte, at last, pacified La Vendée by
    negotiating a treaty of amnesty with the remaining Vendéan leaders at
    Montluçon, on the 17th of January 1800. A special effort was made to
    put the finances in order, and Gaudin, who held office as Minister of
    the Finances throughout the Consulate and the Empire, first proved
    his extraordinary powers. His financial reforms may be roughly summed
    up by the mention of his two most important measures. The decrees of
    the Directory in favour of forced loans from the rich, which had been
    arbitrarily and unfairly carried out, were abrogated and replaced by
    a general income tax of twenty-five per cent. This established some
    justice in the collection, which partly compensated for the heaviness
    of the tax. The second measure was the appointment of receivers-general
    of taxes in every department. These men had to give heavy security, and
    were allowed a fair measure of profit in the form of a percentage on
    what they collected. They were strictly supervised, and the scandalous
    dilapidations which had signalised the period of the Directory were
    made impossible for the future. Further, in order to secure the support
    of the capitalists, the Bank of France was founded under the guarantee
    of the State. Finally, the First Consul decided to carry into effect
    the projects of the legal reformers of the Constituent Assembly and the
    Convention. Their labours had made possible the formation of a uniform
    code of law for France. Bonaparte appointed a Commission, consisting of
    Tronchet, Portalis, and Bigot de Préameneu, to examine the labours of
    their predecessors, and with their help to draw up the admirable civil
    code, which was afterwards known as the Code Napoléon.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span></p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Ministry.</div>

  <p>In no respect was the administrative ability of the Consuls better
    manifested than in the selection they made of their ministers. It has
    already been noticed that Gaudin, the greatest financier of France, was
    appointed Minister of the Finances. Talleyrand and Fouché once more
    took possession of the portfolios of Foreign Affairs and of Police,
    which they held for many years. Their first Minister of the Marine,
    Forfait, did not remain long in office, but his successor, Decrès,
    held that post from 1801 till 1814. The same may be said with regard
    to the Ministry of Justice. Abrial, the first occupant of this post,
    gave way to Regnier in 1802, but he likewise remained in office till
    1814. The Ministries of War and of the Interior were more difficult to
    fill; Carnot soon resented the tone of Bonaparte, and was succeeded
    by Berthier, afterwards Prince of Neufchâtel, who had been Chief of
    the Staff to Bonaparte in Italy. La Place, the great astronomer, had
    been appointed Minister of the Interior by the Provisional Government
    in November 1799. He did not show himself very efficient, and was
    succeeded by Lucien Bonaparte, the First Consul’s ablest brother, in
    the following month. He too failed to carry out the wishes of the
    Consuls, and was succeeded in 1800 by one of the most distinguished
    administrators of the period, Chaptal.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The External Policy of the Consulate.</div>

  <p>Of foreign affairs Bonaparte, as First Consul, assumed the entire
    management; in internal matters he laid down the main principles
    indeed, but he allowed his colleagues some share in the government.
    He found France once more at war, as she had been before the Treaty
    of Campo-Formio, with Austria and England. But another redoubtable
    enemy had been added in Russia. Fortunately for France, for reasons
    which have already been indicated, the Emperor Paul was profoundly
    dissatisfied with his allies. From an unreasoning hatred for France,
    the Russian Emperor had now altered his sentiments to one of profound
    admiration for the person of the First Consul. Bonaparte was soon
    notified of this disposition at the Court of St. Petersburg. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span> sent
    his most intimate friend, Duroc, on a special mission to Russia, and
    the idea was already suggested that Russia and France ought to be the
    arbiters of Europe. He offered to recognise Paul not only as Grand
    Master of the Knights of Malta, but as the sovereign of that island,
    and promised in every way to forward Russian interests. In return,
    Paul, with his usual exaggeration, declared Bonaparte to be his dearest
    friend, surrounded himself with his portraits, drank publicly to his
    health, and ordered Louis <span class="smcap">XVIII.</span> to leave Mittau. The Russian
    ambassador in Paris, Kolichev, on behalf of his master, proposed that
    Bonaparte should take the title of King of France, and make the crown
    hereditary in his family. Next in importance to the commencement of
    good relations with Russia, was the First Consul’s effort to make the
    King of Prussia his declared ally. For this purpose he sent Duroc also
    to Berlin. But Frederick William <span class="smcap">III.</span> was a different type
    of monarch from the Emperor Paul; he could not so readily alter his
    policy. Personally, he too admired the First Consul, and regarded him
    as the restorer of order and as a monarch in embryo; but, in spite of
    his admiration, he refused to comply with the wishes of Bonaparte,
    as he had rejected the propositions of the Directory, and insisted
    on the maintenance of his consistent attitude of strict neutrality.
    The last point to be noticed in the foreign policy of Bonaparte was
    his attitude towards the Pope. He not only allowed the body of Pope
    Pius <span class="smcap">VI.</span> to be removed from Valence to be buried at Rome,
    but he recognised the new Pope, Pius <span class="smcap">VII.</span>, although he had
    been elected at Venice under Austrian influence: he even offered to
    restore him to his temporal dominion at Rome, and promised to enter
    into negotiations with him with regard to the re-establishment of the
    Catholic Church in France.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Campaign of Marengo. 1800.</div>

  <p>With the two great enemies of France, Austria and England, the First
    Consul had no desire to treat. Though unable to strike at England,
    owing to the weakness of the French navy, he could yet attack the
    Austrians in two quarters. Two powerful armies were prepared,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span> the
    one the Army of the Danube, which was placed under the command of
    Moreau, and the other the Army of the Interior, soon to become famous
    as the Second Army of Italy. Of all the conquests in Italy made by
    the French in 1796 and 1797, only Genoa remained in their possession.
    Masséna, fresh from his victories in Switzerland, had taken command of
    the besieged army. His defence is one of the most famous in history,
    and does no less honour to the general than his victory at Zurich.
    Bonaparte desired to relieve Genoa; and he resolved not to advance
    along the coast, as he had done in 1796, but by crossing the Alps, and
    descending upon Piedmont, to cut off the Austrian army occupying that
    province.</p>

  <p>In the month of May Bonaparte crossed the Great Saint Bernard Pass at
    the head of 40,000 men, and fell at once on the Austrian flank. He was
    too late to relieve Genoa, which surrendered on the 4th of June, when
    but few of the soldiers were still able to stand, but he was in time to
    close the retreat of the Austrians upon Lombardy. On the 9th June 1800
    General Lannes defeated the Austrian advanced guard at Montebello, and
    Bonaparte then barred the road from Alessandria to Piacenza. General
    Melas, though not yet joined by the troops which had taken Genoa,
    had a larger army than Bonaparte; on June 14 he forced his way out
    of Alessandria, and drove back the French columns which occupied the
    village of Marengo. The battle was practically lost by the French, when
    Desaix, who had been detached to the left with 6000 men, fell upon
    the Austrian flank. Desaix was killed, but the vigour of his attack
    practically cut the Austrian army in two. The dragoons of Kellermann
    completed the victory, and General Melas signed the Convention of
    Alessandria, by which he surrendered Genoa, Piedmont, and the Milanese
    to the French, and promised to withdraw the Austrian garrisons from all
    cities to the west of the Mincio. Bonaparte then attended a <i>Te Deum</i>
    sung in honour of his victory in the cathedral of Milan, and returned
    to Paris, leaving the Army of Grisons, under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span> the command of General
    Macdonald, to follow up the Austrians.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Campaign of Hohenlinden.</div>

  <p>While Bonaparte was winning the battle of Marengo, and reconquering
    Italy by a single blow, Moreau was again face to face with his old
    opponent, the Archduke Charles. The French advance was very slow.
    Fierce battles were fought at Engen, Mœskirchen, and Biberach in May
    1800, and by the close of the summer Moreau had his headquarters at
    Augsburg, and his advanced guard at Munich. The slowness of Moreau’s
    progress dissatisfied the First Consul, as did the want of success
    of the Archduke Charles dissatisfy the court of Vienna. Augereau was
    sent with 20,000 men to the assistance of Moreau, who was ordered, in
    spite of the severity of the winter, to continue his advance; and the
    Archduke John was appointed to succeed his brother, and ordered to take
    the offensive. The crowning event of this winter campaign was the great
    victory of Hohenlinden, which was won by Moreau on the 3d of December
    1800. The Austrians lost the whole of their baggage and artillery and
    12,000 prisoners.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Winter Campaign of 1800.</div>

  <p>The First Consul from Paris ordered Moreau and Macdonald to advance
    into the home districts of the House of Austria. Moreau accordingly
    pushed along the Inn, the Salz, the Traun, and the Ens, driving the
    disorganised and discouraged Austrians before him until he was within
    twenty leagues of Vienna. Macdonald, at the same time, crossed the
    Splügen Pass in spite of the avalanches, and penetrated into the
    Tyrol, thus turning the Austrian forces on the Mincio and the Adige.
    On arriving at Trent, Macdonald turned to the right and was joined by
    Brune, who had occupied the territory of Venice, and the united French
    army marched upon Vienna. Under these circumstances, with Italy lost,
    and Vienna threatened from two quarters, the Emperor Francis sued for
    peace, which was concluded at Lunéville on the 9th of February 1801.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Treaty of Lunéville. Feb. 9, 1801.</div>

  <p>The Treaty of Lunéville was more important from its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span> destruction of the
    old Holy Roman Empire than as the treaty of peace between France and
    Austria. From the latter point of view the Emperor Francis once more,
    as in the Treaty of Campo-Formio, recognised the Rhine as the limit
    of France. In Italy the Cisalpine Republic was once more constituted
    with the Adige as its frontier, Modena was to be compensated with the
    Breisgau, and Venice was again left to the House of Austria. Tuscany
    was taken from its Austrian Grand Duke, and erected into a kingdom of
    Etruria in favour of the Prince of Parma, a relative of the King of
    Spain, and Piedmont was annexed to France; but the King of the Two
    Sicilies was allowed to retain his dominions, and the Pope was restored
    to all his possessions except the Legations of Bologna and Ferrara.
    The Cisalpine Republic was reorganised, and granted a Constitution on
    the model of that of the Year <span class="smcap">VIII.</span>, in which Bonaparte was
    appointed First Consul. The Ligurian Republic was maintained, with
    the alteration that its Doge was nominated by France instead of being
    elected. The result of the new arrangements in Northern Italy was that
    both France and Austria had a foothold by their occupation of Piedmont
    and Venice, with the Cisalpine Republic as a buffer between them.
    The principle of secularising the German bishoprics was also again
    recognised in the Treaty of Lunéville, and the actual manner in which
    it should be carried out was referred to a special commission, whose
    conclusions were not adopted till 1803. The principal result of the
    treaty in Austria was the retirement of the minister Thugut, who was
    succeeded as State Chancellor by Count Louis Cobenzl, the diplomatist,
    who had negotiated the treaties both of Campo-Formio and of Lunéville.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Murder of the Emperor Paul. 23d March 1801.</div>

  <p>The admiration of the Emperor Paul for Bonaparte increased daily, and
    it was the Russian Czar, not the French First Consul, who proposed an
    invasion of India across Asia, in order to strike a blow at the English
    power in the East. Indeed, the English had taken the place of the
    French in the mind of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span> Paul, who, not satisfied with forming once again
    the Neutral League of the North, determined to send his best troops
    against them. The Emperor’s proposition was that one expedition should
    consist of 35,000 Frenchmen and 35,000 Russians, under the command of
    Masséna. This column was to go down the Danube, and then up the Don to
    a point whence it would be but a short march to the Volga. It was then
    to proceed down the Volga to Astrakhan, thence across the Caspian Sea
    to Astrabad, and then to march by Herat and Kandahar to the Punjab.
    Another column was to move by Khiva and Bokhara, and to invade India
    by the north of Afghanistan. These grandiose plans were not entirely
    accepted by Bonaparte, and the death of the Emperor prevented an
    attempt being made to see if they were practicable. The madness of Paul
    had steadily increased during his short reign. His nobility disapproved
    heartily of his war policy, both against France and later against
    England; his adoption of the Neutral League and its policy had done
    much to ruin the wealthy nobles of Northern Russia by forbidding the
    exportation of Russian commodities on English ships. To the discontent
    of the nobility, of the politicians, and of the capitalists must be
    added the fears of the courtiers. Even the heir to the throne, his
    eldest son Alexander, perceived that the rule of the maniac could not
    be borne much longer. It is hardly necessary to particularise all the
    causes of his unpopularity; it is enough to say that his behaviour
    was that of a madman. Certain courtiers, of whom the leaders were
    Count Pahlen, a Livonian nobleman; Benningsen, a Hanoverian general;
    Plato Zubov, the last favourite of the Empress Catherine, and his
    brother Nicholas, and the Prince Jachvill, determined to put an end
    to the tyranny of the Czar. In the night of the 23d of March 1801
    he was attacked by these conspirators and ordered to sign an act of
    abdication; he refused; the lamp went out, and the Emperor was struck
    down and strangled by an unknown hand among his assailants.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Neutral League of the North. 1800–1.</div>

  <p>When Bonaparte first entered office he recognised that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span> England was
    a more formidable, because a less approachable, enemy than Austria.
    Knowing that the French navy was unable to meet the English, he hoped
    to counterbalance the maritime preponderance of England by a league
    against her commerce. Owing to the long period of war, nothing was to
    be gained by solemn decrees forbidding the importation of goods into
    France, it was necessary to strike through the neutral nations. The
    three great commercial seats of English trade were the Levant, the
    Baltic, and Portugal. The failure of the expedition to Egypt proved
    that it was impossible to destroy the English trade in the Levant, and
    Bonaparte therefore resolved to strike in the other two directions.
    Acting mainly through the Emperor Paul, the Armed Neutrality of the
    North, or the Neutral League of 1780, was re-established between
    the Baltic powers of Russia, Prussia, Sweden, and Denmark. The real
    intention of Paul and of Bonaparte was to exclude English commerce
    entirely from the Baltic; but for the second time the Baltic powers
    nominally made themselves the guarantors of the rights of neutrals.
    They protested against the right assumed by England to search neutral
    ships, and to confiscate as contraband of war all the goods of
    belligerent powers found in them, and also against the prohibition
    against neutral ships trading between different enemies’ ports. The
    Emperor Paul, like the Empress Catherine twenty years before, made
    himself the patron of the Neutral League.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Battle of Copenhagen. 2d April 1801.</div>

  <p>The English government naturally refused to accede to the demands of
    the Neutral League, and when the Baltic was closed to them an English
    fleet was ordered to force the blockade. This fleet was placed under
    the command of Sir Hyde Parker, with Nelson as second in command. On
    the 30th of March 1801 the fleet sailed down the Sound, in spite of the
    Danish batteries at Elsinore, and on the 2d of April Copenhagen was
    bombarded and a large part of the Danish fleet destroyed. This victory,
    and still more the death of the Emperor Paul, caused the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span> dissolution
    of the Neutral League of the North, and Bonaparte had to adjourn for
    some years his schemes for the annihilation of English commerce.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Spain and Portugal. 1800–1.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Treaty of Badajoz.</div>

  <p>In the Iberian peninsula the designs of Bonaparte against English trade
    were more successful. Spain still remained the ally of France in spite
    of the sufferings that alliance had brought upon her, but Portugal had
    hitherto continued the faithful friend of England. Through Portugal
    English goods entered Spain and the south of France, and Bonaparte
    resolved to put an end to the neutrality of Portugal. For this purpose,
    in the year 1800, he despatched his ablest brother, Lucien Bonaparte,
    as ambassador to Madrid, with orders to negotiate with the Prince
    Regent of Portugal. The terms offered were that the Portuguese ports
    were to be closed to English trade, that special commercial advantages
    were to be given to French merchants, that French Guiana was to
    be extended to the river Amazon, and that a portion of Portuguese
    territory was to be ceded to Spain until Trinidad and Minorca were
    recovered by the latter power. The Prince Regent of Portugal rejected
    these hard terms; Spain declared war in the beginning of 1801, and
    22,000 veteran French soldiers, under the command of General Leclerc,
    Bonaparte’s brother-in-law, were sent to the assistance of Spain.
    The campaign was a very short one. The French troops never came into
    action; but the Portuguese were twice defeated in pitched battles, and
    lost some of their fortresses. The Prince Regent sued for peace, and a
    treaty was signed between Spain and Portugal at Badajoz on the 6th of
    June 1801. By this treaty the city and district of Olivenza were ceded
    to Spain, and, by a subsequent arrangement, the limits of French Guiana
    were extended to the river Amazon. Bonaparte was much disgusted with
    these treaties, and especially with the continued refusal of Portugal
    to close her ports to English commerce, and it was many months before
    he consented to ratify them. England refused to recognise Portugal as
    an enemy; but an English force occupied the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span> island of Madeira, and the
    East India Company’s troops garrisoned Goa.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Campaign in Egypt. 1800–1.</div>

  <p>When Bonaparte left Egypt he was unable, owing to the stringency of
    the blockade maintained by the English fleet, to take more than a few
    companions with him. Kléber, who, as has been said, succeeded him
    in the command of the French army, soon found himself confronted by
    a powerful Turkish and Mameluke army. This army he defeated at the
    battle of Heliopolis on the 20th of March 1800, after which success
    Egypt again submitted to French rule. On the 14th of June 1800, the
    very day on which his former comrade Desaix met a soldier’s death at
    the battle of Marengo, Kléber was assassinated by a Muhammadan fanatic
    in Cairo. Menou, the new French general in Egypt, was in every way
    Kléber’s inferior, and concentrated the French troops in the two cities
    of Cairo and Alexandria. Isolated entirely from the mother country, and
    unable to receive reinforcements or ammunition, the English government
    regarded the French in Egypt as an easy prey. On the 19th of March 1801
    a powerful English army disembarked at Aboukir, under the command of
    Sir Ralph Abercromby, and defeated the French before Alexandria two
    days later in a pitched battle, in which Abercromby was killed. Siege
    was then laid to Alexandria and Cairo, and both cities surrendered to
    the English general, Lord Hutchinson, before the arrival of a division
    from India, which, under the command of Sir David Baird, had sailed up
    the Red Sea, marched across the Soudan desert, and descended the Nile
    to Cairo in boats. As a result of these operations, a convention was
    signed between the French and English generals in Egypt on the 2d of
    September 1801, by which the French garrisons evacuated all remaining
    posts, and were conveyed to France in English ships.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Peace of Amiens. 25th March 1802.</div>

  <p>Though neither Bonaparte nor the leaders of English political opinion
    believed it possible for a permanent peace to be agreed to in the
    interests of their respective countries, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span> outcry of both the
    English and the French people against the prolonged war made it
    necessary for their rulers to conclude some kind of a truce. Pitt had
    in 1801 gone out of office, and his successor Addington, afterwards
    Lord Sidmouth, declared in favour of a peace policy. The treaty, which
    is known as the Peace of Amiens, was really nothing more than a truce.
    Only a very general agreement was come to, and many essential points
    were left undecided. Both nations needed a rest, and neither government
    looked upon the Peace of Amiens as affording a permanent solution of
    their differences. Many loopholes were left, which were certain to
    afford pretexts for renewing the war to both contracting powers, and of
    these the most notable was the question of the possession of Malta.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Reconstitution of Germany.</div>

  <p>Far more important than the temporary Peace of Amiens was the
    reconstitution of Germany, which was finally accepted by the Diet at
    Ratisbon on the 25th of February 1803. The Holy Roman Empire which
    had lasted so many centuries ceased to exist. The ancient division
    of the Empire into circles was abolished, and the three colleges
    which formed the Diet were profoundly affected. Instead of the eight
    electors, three ecclesiastical and five lay, that formerly existed,
    ten electors, one ecclesiastical and nine lay, were created. The
    Archbishops of Cologne and Trèves, whose states being on the left bank
    of the Rhine were absorbed into France, lost their electoral dignity.
    The Archbishop-Elector of Mayence was retained as Arch-Chancellor of
    the Empire, and he received as his dominions the Bishopric of Ratisbon,
    the Principality of Aschaffenburg, and the County of Wetzlar. The
    nine lay electors were the five princes who had formerly enjoyed the
    dignity, namely, the Electors of Bohemia, Brandenburg, Saxony, Bavaria,
    and Hanover, and four new Electors, the Margrave of Baden, the Duke
    of Würtemburg, the Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel, and the Grand Duke
    Ferdinand, brother of the Emperor, and former Grand Duke of Tuscany,
    who was appointed Elector<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span> of Salzburg. By this new arrangement, and
    by the abolition of two-thirds of the ecclesiastical electorate, the
    majority in the College of Electors passed from the Catholics to the
    Protestants. In the College of Princes there was the same result, for
    by the secularisation of the Catholic bishoprics the majority passed to
    the Protestant rulers. More sweeping still was the alteration in the
    third College—that of the Free Cities. Instead of fifty-two constituent
    members of this College only six were retained, and their maintenance
    was due to the intervention of France. These six cities were Augsburg,
    Bremen, Frankfort-on-the-Main, Hamburg, Lübeck, and Nuremberg. By these
    changes the constitution of the Empire was entirely altered; but still
    more notable was the change in the position of the various princes in
    Germany, for the tendency of the secularisation of the ecclesiastical
    states was to diminish the number of ruling princes and to increase the
    extent of their dominions.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Secularisations in Germany.</div>

  <p>The great war with France had shown the weakness of the Empire as an
    organisation, and had also proved the advantages to the inhabitants
    of the existence of large and powerful states. It was, therefore,
    the already existing kingdoms which received the greatest addition
    of territory under the new arrangements. Nominally, the secularised
    bishoprics were intended to compensate those German princes whose
    territories on the left bank of the Rhine had been ceded to France;
    practically, the powerful states only were increased. Austria, whose
    new possession of Venice in place of the Milanese had been reaffirmed
    by the Treaty of Lunéville, only acquired in Germany the Bishoprics of
    Brixen and Trent, but two Austrian princes received independent states,
    namely, the Grand Duke of Tuscany, Ferdinand, who, as has been said,
    was given the Archbishopric of Salzburg, with the title of Elector,
    and the Duke of Modena, who received the Breisgau. Nevertheless, the
    power of Austria was greatly weakened, for under the old arrangement
    the ecclesiastical electors and the Catholic bishops had always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span> been
    partisans of Austria. Prussia was the country which profited the
    most, though she had suffered the least in the war against France. In
    exchange for part of the Duchy of Cleves, the Duchy of Guelders, and
    the County of Moers, Prussia received the large and wealthy Bishoprics
    of Hildesheim, Paderborn, Erfurt, and part of Münster, together with
    a number of abbeys, of which the largest were Herford, Quedlinburg,
    Elten, Essen, and Werden, and several free cities. Hanover received
    the Bishopric of Osnabrück, to which the King of England, as Elector
    of Hanover, had previously possessed the alternate nomination. Bavaria
    was made into a powerful and concentrated state. In exchange for the
    Palatinate, the Duchy of Deux-Ponts (Zweibrücken), the Principalities
    of Juliers, Simmern and Lautern, she received the Bishoprics of
    Würtzburg, Bamberg, Augsburg, Freisingen, and part of Passau, together
    with a large number of abbeys and free cities. Baden received the
    portion of the Bishoprics of Spires, Strasbourg, and Basle, situated
    on the right bank of the Rhine, the Bishopric of Constance, the
    cities of Heidelberg and Mannheim, and many abbeys and free cities.
    Finally, the Duchy of Würtemburg, in exchange for the Principality
    of Montbéliard, received abbeys and free towns, which increased its
    population by a hundred thousand inhabitants. It is not necessary to
    describe the various accessions granted to the Princes of Hesse-Cassel,
    Hesse-Darmstadt, Nassau, and the rest; but, it may be noted that the
    Prince of Orange, the former Stadtholder of Holland, received the
    Bishopric of Fulda. These changes remodelled Germany, and in the result
    were most prejudicial to France; for instead of there existing a series
    of buffers in the shape of small and weak states, France was brought
    almost directly into contact with Prussia and Austria.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Reconstitution of Switzerland.</div>

  <p>At the same time that the ancient federal Holy Roman Empire was
    reconstituted, the ancient federal Republic of Switzerland was likewise
    reorganised. The reasons which had induced the Directory to intervene
    in Swiss affairs still existed; the revolutionary party<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span> which opposed
    the federal idea, and desired to form a united Switzerland, remained
    in direct opposition to the supporters of the former government of the
    cantons. It was essentially the question of government which divided
    the two parties, and there was no suggestion of restoring the feudal
    system, or the privileges of certain towns and certain cantons over
    others. The breath of the French Revolution had swept away political
    inequalities as completely in Switzerland as in France. Soon after the
    Treaty of Amiens, Bonaparte withdrew the French troops from the new
    Helvetic Republic. Civil war, as he expected, recommenced, and the
    Helvetic Government was driven from Berne by the federalists. Bonaparte
    therefore despatched an army to restore order, and summoned the
    leading Swiss statesmen to Paris. To them he propounded a new scheme
    of federal government, which was accepted, and the Act of Mediation,
    which was promulgated on the 19th of February 1803, established the
    new Constitution, and recognised the First Consul as Mediator. By
    the Act of Mediation Switzerland was divided into nineteen cantons,
    each of which had its own local government and special laws and
    taxes. The thirteen old cantons were maintained; six of them were
    democratic—Appenzell, Glarus, Schwyz, Unterwalden, Uri, and Zug;
    seven were oligarchical—Basle, Berne, Friburg, Lucerne, Schaffhausen,
    Soleure, and Zürich. The six new cantons added by Bonaparte comprised
    five territories which had formerly been subject; the Pays de Vaud
    and Aargau were made independent of Berne; Thurgau was separated from
    Schaffhausen, and Ticino from Uri and Unterwalden, and the canton of
    Saint-Gall was formed out of certain districts formerly belonging to
    Appenzell, Glarus, and Schwyz; finally, the Grisons, which had hitherto
    been an independent mountain republic, was declared a canton of
    Switzerland. Geneva had some years before been added to France as the
    Department of the Leman, and the Valais was now declared independent—a
    preliminary step to its ultimate annexation by France. The Federal
    Diet was to consist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span> of twenty-five deputies, two from the six largest
    cantons, Aargau, Berne, the Grisons, Saint-Gall, the Pays de Vaud,
    and Zurich, and one from each of the others. The Diet was to meet
    every year in the capital of a different canton, and the Landamman
    of that canton was for that year the President of the Confederation.
    The Federal Act once more declared the entire abolition of feudalism,
    and of all privileges of birth, etc., and forbade for the future all
    internal customs duties. Bonaparte proclaimed that he would not allow
    the interference of any other power in Switzerland, and took the title
    of Mediator of the Confederation of Switzerland.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Concordat. 1801–2.</div>

  <p>It has already been stated that Bonaparte desired to stand well with
    the Catholic Church, and had recognised the advantages of a state
    religion. One of his most important measures during the Consulate was
    to put an end to the schism which had lasted since the promulgation of
    the Civil Constitution of the Clergy in 1790, with the assistance of
    the Pope, Pius <span class="smcap">VII.</span> All the bishops elected under the Civil
    Constitution of the Clergy, and most of those who had emigrated, sooner
    than take the oath of allegiance to it, resigned, and the leaders of
    both sections were nominated and instituted to different dioceses.
    A new circumscription of sees was agreed to, and France was divided
    into fifty bishoprics and ten archbishoprics. It was agreed by the
    Concordat, which was signed between the Pope and the First Consul on
    the 15th of July 1801, and solemnly proclaimed on the 18th of April
    1802, after being sanctioned by the Legislative Body, that the First
    Consul should nominate all bishops, and the Pope should institute.
    The government of the Consulate recognised the Catholic, Apostolic
    and Roman religion as that of the majority of the French people, and
    ordained that its public worship should be carried on freely so long as
    the police regulations were observed. All ecclesiastics were to swear
    fidelity to the government, which promised to pay a suitable salary to
    all bishops and curés. In return, the Pope promised that neither he
    nor his successors would lay any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span> claim to the ecclesiastical estates
    which had been alienated, and that all such property should be held the
    indisputable possession of its purchaser.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Internal Organisation.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">The Prefectures.</div>

  <p>The recognition of the frontier of the Rhine by the Treaty of Lunéville
    and the Diet of Ratisbon largely increased the territory of France.
    The First Consul proceeded to organise the additions on the bases
    laid down by the Constituent Assembly, Convention, and Directory.
    Belgium was divided into nine departments. The Rhenish territories,
    including the Palatinate, the Diocese of Trèves, etc., were divided
    into four departments, of which the headquarters were Aix-la-Chapelle,
    Coblentz, Mayence, and Trèves. Further south, the Department of the
    Mont-Terrible, which had been formed by the Convention out of the
    Republic of Mulhouse and the District of Porentruy, was merged into the
    Department of the Haut-Rhin, and the Principality of Montbéliard was
    united to the Department of the Doubs. The Republic of Geneva, as has
    been said, formed the Department of the Leman. Savoy was constituted
    as the Department of Mont-Blanc, and the County of Nice that of the
    Alpes-Maritimes. These were the recognised limits of France in 1801,
    and were defensible on geographical grounds; but, on the 11th of
    September 1802, Bonaparte went further, and declared the union of
    Piedmont with France. Instead of being amalgamated with the Cisalpine
    Republic, Piedmont was divided into six departments, and the island
    of Elba was detached from Tuscany and declared, like Corsica, to be a
    French island. At the head of each department a Préfet was appointed,
    to take the place of the national agents maintained by the Directory.
    At the head of each subdivision, now called an arrondissement instead
    of a district, was placed a Sous-Préfet, also nominated by the supreme
    executive, and at the head of each commune was the Maire, who was also
    nominated and not elected. Préfets, Sous-Préfets, and Maires were
    assisted by nominated councils in administrative matters, and appeals
    from their decisions lay to the Council of State.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span></p>

  <div class="sidenote">Education.</div>

  <p>Just as Bonaparte had built up the new Code of Law on the bases laid
    by the Legislative Committee of the Convention, so, too, he made use
    of the labours of its Committee of Public Instruction to establish
    a scheme of national education. In every commune which could afford
    the expense, he maintained the primary school established by the
    Convention; but he feared to burden the National Treasury with the
    expense of schools in the poorer communes, and preferred to leave their
    establishment to local endeavour. In secondary education, he suppressed
    the central schools of the Convention, and replaced them by twenty-nine
    lycées, specially intended for the education of the middle classes. For
    higher education, he founded ten schools of law and six of medicine;
    he improved the Polytechnic School, and started a school of mechanics,
    which became later the famous École des Arts et Métiers. The key-stone
    of the whole educational system, the foundation of the University, was,
    however, not laid till some years later.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Constitutional Changes.</div>

  <p>The great administrative reforms of Bonaparte made him as popular among
    all classes of the population as his victories had made him in the
    army. Not only in France, but throughout Europe, he was looked upon as
    the restorer of order and good government. This sentiment appeared most
    vividly at the time when a plot against his life was discovered on the
    24th of September 1800. This plot, which is known as the Conspiracy
    of the Infernal Machine, is said to have been the work of the Jacobin
    party; the explosion took place in the Rue Sainte-Nicaise, too late
    to do him any harm, but it was used as a pretext to exile the most
    vigorous republicans. So great was his popularity, that rumours were
    already heard of making him monarch. The first step in this direction
    was taken in 1802, when the Council of State proposed that the primary
    assemblies should be summoned to decide whether Bonaparte should not be
    made First Consul for life. In May 1802 this proposal was laid before
    the people, and was carried by more than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span> 3,500,000 votes to 8000. Some
    slight changes were made at the same time, of which the most important
    were that the First Consul was enabled to nominate his successor, that
    the lists of candidates for public functions were replaced by electoral
    colleges appointed for life, and that the Senate was given the right to
    dissolve the Tribunate and the Legislative Body.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Bonaparte’s Colonial Policy.</div>

  <p>The First Consul clearly understood that the Peace of Amiens was not
    likely to last, and that war would soon break out again with England.
    He knew that England derived much of her influence from her navy and
    her colonies; he therefore spared no efforts to restore the French
    navy, and to make France once more a colonial power. His first essays
    in this direction were to obtain Louisiana from Spain in exchange for
    the kingdom of Etruria, formed in Italy for Prince Louis of Parma, and
    the extension of the limits of French Guiana to the Amazon extorted
    from Portugal. But his main project was to restore the French power
    in the West Indies. Guadeloupe and Martinique and the French Antilles
    had been restored to France by the Treaty of Amiens, and the First
    Consul resolved to make them the starting-point for the reconquest of
    San Domingo. This island had, as a result of the policy of Sonthonax
    and Polverel, the proconsuls of the Convention, been entirely lost
    to France; the planters and other whites had fled; and the revolted
    slaves and mulattoes were masters of the island. Toussaint Louverture,
    the leader of the negroes, refused to hold any communications with
    Bonaparte, and the First Consul therefore, as soon as the Peace of
    Amiens had opened the sea, sent an expedition of 20,000 men against
    him, commanded by his brother-in-law, General Leclerc. The island
    was reconquered by May 1802; but the victorious army was practically
    destroyed by yellow fever. Toussaint Louverture was taken prisoner and
    sent to France: but nevertheless, as soon as war with England again
    broke out, and the arrival of reinforcements was prevented by English
    cruisers, the negroes rose afresh under new leaders and destroyed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
    remnant of the garrison. It may be added that the French Antilles were
    recaptured by the English in 1809 and 1810.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Recommencement of the War between England and France. 18th
    May 1803.</div>

  <p>It has been said that the Treaty of Amiens was practically only a
    truce, and that many points of interest to the two nations were left
    undecided. Of these the most important regarded Malta. The English
    ministry positively refused to surrender this island to the Knights
    of Saint John, under the protectorate of the Emperor Alexander,
    which would leave it at the mercy of France. Bonaparte demanded the
    evacuation of Malta with much insistance as one of the conditions of
    the Treaty of Amiens; but the English government in reply pointed to
    the annexation of Elba, Parma and Piacenza, and Piedmont, and the
    interference in Switzerland, as also being breaches of the treaty. The
    First Consul was also very exasperated at the personal attacks made on
    him in the irresponsible English press. He failed to understand that
    by the English law the government could not prevent the publication
    of libels against him, and regarded their refusal to punish the
    libellers as personal insults to himself. The French ambassador in
    London prosecuted Peltier, the chief libeller, before the Court of
    King’s Bench. He was brilliantly defended by Sir J. Mackintosh, and
    only ordered to pay a small fine. A public subscription was raised to
    pay his fine and costs, and the First Consul regarded this as adding
    a further insult to the injuries he had received. In truth, both
    governments felt that war was inevitable, and in May 1803 the rupture
    was complete. The English navy began to seize the French trading
    vessels, and the First Consul, as a reprisal, arrested all the English
    travellers he could find in France, and ordered Mortier to occupy
    Hanover.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Position of Foreign Affairs.</div>

  <p>The First Consul entered upon a fresh war with England with a light
    heart, for he believed that she would be unable to obtain any allies.
    Austria was exhausted by the terrible wars she had undergone, and the
    State Chancellor, Cobenzl, held that she needed time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span> to recuperate.
    Prussia persisted in her attitude of strict neutrality; Haugwitz was
    dismissed from the Secretaryship of State for Foreign Affairs as
    being too French in his sympathies, after the occupation of Hanover,
    and was succeeded by Hardenberg, the maker of the Treaty of Basle.
    Spain was Bonaparte’s faithful and hopeful ally; and Russia, the
    most formidable of the continental powers, inclined to his side. The
    attitude of the Emperor Alexander at this period was of the greatest
    importance. Educated by a Swiss publicist who sincerely loved France,
    La Harpe, the Emperor of Russia was inclined to admire the results of
    the French Revolution and the French people. His sentiments for the
    person of Bonaparte were nearly as full of enthusiastic admiration as
    those of his father, the Emperor Paul. He made the French ambassadors
    at St. Petersburg, Duroc and Caulaincourt, his personal friends, and
    wrote letters to Bonaparte expressing his feelings. But the Emperor’s
    relatives, especially his mother, with his ministers and his courtiers,
    were opposed to France and in favour of a close alliance with England,
    or at the very least of the maintenance of strict neutrality. England
    practically commanded the Russian trade, and war with England meant
    the loss of the only market for Russian raw material, the consequent
    impoverishment of the Russian people, and the ruin of the Russian
    capitalists. Nevertheless the Emperor Alexander was an autocrat, and
    Bonaparte counted upon his friendship even though he could not secure
    his alliance.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Plot of Pichegru and Cadoudal.</div>

  <p>On the outbreak of war the numerous French exiles in England offered
    their services to the English Government. It is significant of the
    change which had come over the state of affairs that, instead of
    endeavouring to raise a counter-revolution, they proposed to attack the
    person of the First Consul. The leaders of the new plot were Pichegru,
    now a declared royalist and partisan of the Bourbons, and Georges
    Cadoudal, the celebrated Chouan leader. Both had the audacity to go to
    Paris and to enter into relations with General Moreau. Moreau, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
    he resented the lofty position of Bonaparte and refused to serve him,
    would be no party to an assassination, more especially an assassination
    which would restore the Bourbons, and Cadoudal and Pichegru had to
    act with the assistance of certain French noblemen and some former
    Chouans. A plot was formed to murder the First Consul on the road
    from Malmaison to Paris, but it was discovered by the French police,
    and Bonaparte in terror ordered the gates of Paris to be closed as in
    the most terrible days of the Revolution, and proclaimed the pain of
    death against all who sheltered the conspirators. After some daring
    adventures the leaders were seized; Georges Cadoudal was executed;
    Pichegru was strangled in prison; and Moreau, who was condemned to two
    years’ imprisonment, was allowed to go into exile in the United States.
    The French noblemen implicated were treated with more leniency, and the
    lives of their two chiefs, Armand de Polignac and Charles de Rivière,
    were spared.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Execution of the Duc d’Enghien. 21st March 1804.</div>

  <p>The discovery of this plot against his life, which was undoubtedly
    fostered by the Bourbon princes, made the First Consul determined to
    wreak his vengeance against that unfortunate family. Being unable to
    seize the persons of the pretender, Louis <span class="smcap">XVIII.</span>, and his
    brother, the Comte d’Artois, who resided in England, he carried off a
    young Bourbon prince, the eldest son of the Prince de Condé, who was
    quite innocent of the conspiracy of Pichegru. The Duc d’Enghien was
    at this time living at Ettenheim in the Grand Duchy of Baden. He was
    arrested there by French soldiers, contrary to all international law,
    and taken to Vincennes. He was at once tried by a military commission
    as an <i>émigré</i> who had borne arms against France, and was condemned to
    death. The sentence was immediately carried out in spite of the demands
    of the young prince for an interview with the First Consul. This
    execution was a great political mistake. Bonaparte expected that it
    would terrify the Bourbon princes, but it reacted to his own prejudice.
    The Court of Saint Petersburg went into mourning; the King<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span> of Prussia,
    who had at last almost resolved to make an alliance with France, began
    to negotiate with Russia; the royal family of Austria looked upon the
    execution as a pendant to that of Marie Antoinette; and the English
    Government made use of the horror caused by it to endeavour to form a
    fresh coalition against France.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Bonaparte becomes Emperor of the French. 18th May 1804.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Francis II. becomes Emperor of Austria.</div>

  <p>Directly after this tragedy, which proved that Bonaparte was
    practically an absolute monarch, he decided to take upon himself the
    rank of Emperor of the French. The Senate offered this title to the
    First Consul at Saint-Cloud on the 18th of May 1804, and the people
    ratified it by a majority of more than 3,500,000 votes. By the <i>senatus
      consultum</i> which made him Emperor the office was made hereditary to
    his direct descendants. As he had no children he was given the power
    to adopt, a power which it was undoubtedly expected would be used in
    favour of his step-son, Eugène de Beauharnais. A few months after the
    Corsican soldier of fortune was declared Emperor of the French, the
    last Holy Roman Emperor, Francis <span class="smcap">II.</span>, resolved to rid himself
    of what was now but an empty title. The new Constitution of the Holy
    Roman Empire had destroyed the imperial authority by depriving it of
    the votes of the ecclesiastical members in the Diet, and increasing or
    consolidating the dominions of the principal German states. Francis
    <span class="smcap">II.</span> acknowledged the new order of things. On the 11th of
    August 1804, he erected the Austrian dominions into an hereditary
    empire, and on the 7th of December following, five days after the
    coronation of Bonaparte as the Emperor Napoleon by the Pope at Paris,
    the last Holy Roman Emperor proclaimed himself Emperor of Austria under
    the title of Francis <span class="smcap">I.</span> This then was the result of fifteen
    years of revolution, the disappearance of the ancient figure-head of
    Europe, and the creation of a new Empire founded on the power of the
    sword.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Empire.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Napoleon’s</span> elevation to the rank of Emperor of the French only
    legalised in a more striking fashion the possession of power which he
    had long held. It did not make his authority any greater, for he had
    been practically the absolute monarch of France ever since 1799, but
    it gave promise of permanency, and that was what the French people
    most needed after the series of successive governments which had run
    their course since 1789. It is a mistake to regard Napoleon as having
    been made supreme ruler of France by the army alone; the legalisation
    of his power was even more enthusiastically received by the peaceful
    part of the population. The few ardent republicans who were left
    had been terrified out of resistance by the wholesale<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span> deportation
    of the principal Jacobins after the affair of the Infernal Machine.
    The adherents of the Bourbons were equally discouraged by the severe
    punishment dealt out to Pichegru and Georges Cadoudal. Every section
    of both the military and civil communities was ready to hail Napoleon
    as Emperor. But in the institution of the Empire he appealed to more
    than men’s interests, he appealed to their imaginations. This he did
    in two ways. He created a Court, with all the magnificent apparatus of
    the great officers of the household, stately ceremonies and ancient
    customs, which gave to the people of Paris the spectacle of royal pomp
    which they had long regretted. On the other hand, he called to his
    assistance the most powerful engine for influencing the imagination of
    men, namely, religion. He determined to be consecrated with a ceremony
    which should exceed in splendour all the coronation ceremonies of
    the Bourbons. He summoned the Pope to France, and instead of being
    crowned at Rheims by the Archbishop and Primate, he received his
    crown at Paris from the hands of the Holy Father himself. At the very
    moment of his coronation he showed a pride of bearing at least equal
    to that of any of his predecessors upon the throne of France. After
    the Pope had anointed him, girded the sword of empire about him, and
    given him the sceptre, he prepared to place the crown upon the head
    of the new Caesar. But Napoleon gently took the crown from the hands
    of Pius <span class="smcap">VII.</span>, and after replacing it on the altar, raised it
    and crowned himself. The presence of the Pope in Paris for this great
    ceremony following upon the Concordat, caused Napoleon to be looked
    upon as the restorer of the Catholic religion, and greatly strengthened
    his position. Not satisfied with the crown of France, he accepted that
    of Italy also on the 20th of May 1805, and proceeded to Milan, where
    he placed upon his head the Iron Crown of the old Lombard Kings. He at
    once declared his intention of not personally administering his Italian
    kingdom, and appointed his step-son, Eugène de Beauharnais, to be
    Viceroy of Italy.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Imperial Court.</div>

  <p>It has been said that Napoleon created a new Court, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span> was intended
    to efface the recollection of the magnificence of the old Court of
    Versailles. At the head of this Court he created a hierarchy of
    Grand Dignitaries of the Empire, who were designed to form a Council
    of Regency in case of necessity. The chief of them was the Grand
    Elector, whose duty was to convoke the Senate, the Legislative Body,
    and the Electoral Colleges,—this post was conferred on the Emperor’s
    elder brother, Joseph Bonaparte. Next ranked the Arch-Chancellor of
    the Empire, who was the chief of the judicial body,—this post was
    conferred on Cambacérès, the former Second Consul. Third came the
    Arch-Chancellor of State, whose business it was to receive foreign
    ambassadors and ratify treaties—this post was conferred upon Eugène de
    Beauharnais. Next came the Arch-Treasurer of the Empire, which post was
    first filled by Le Brun, the former Third Consul, and the remaining
    Grand Dignitaries were the Constable of the Empire, Louis Bonaparte,
    the Grand Admiral, Marshal Murat, and the Grand Judge, Regnier. In
    the same way as the Grand Dignitaries were at the head of the civil
    administration of the Empire, Napoleon created Marshals of France to be
    the representatives of the army. The first marshals were eighteen in
    number, and included all the most famous generals of the revolutionary
    period except Pichegru and Moreau, whose fate has been related. It was
    indispensable for the rank of Marshal of France to have commanded an
    army in the field, or at least a detached corps, and the office was
    surrounded with so many privileges as to make it the object of ambition
    to every colonel of a French regiment. The third hierarchy consisted of
    the great officers of the Emperor’s household, who comprised a Grand
    Marshal, Duroc; a Grand Almoner, his uncle, Joseph Fesch, whom he had
    induced the Pope to make a cardinal; a Grand Chamberlain, Talleyrand;
    a Grand Huntsman, Marshal Berthier; and a Grand Equerry, Caulaincourt;
    and most of the first occupants of these offices were personal friends
    and former comrades in arms of the Emperor.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Institutions of the Empire.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Administrative System of the Empire.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Napoleon’s Ministers.</div>

  <p>The Senate remained under the Constitution of the Empire, as under
    that of the Consulate, the most important and dignified political
    body. It was extended by the addition of the Grand Dignitaries, of
    the members of the Emperor’s family, and of those whom he specially
    wished to reward; its seats were conferred for life; but it did little
    but congratulate the Emperor on all his proceedings. The Tribunate
    was reduced to fifty members, and the Legislative Body was allowed
    to discuss laws, but only in closed committees. These institutions,
    carefully devised though they were to maintain a semblance of free
    discussion, were really reduced to impotence by the autocratic power
    of the Emperor. The Council of State became more and more the real
    key-stone of the administration of France. It was the one institution
    of the Consulate which developed under the Empire. But it did not
    develop collectively, but rather as a convenient administrative centre
    and a court of appeal for administrators in every branch of the
    government. Though the ministries were maintained, they were, as the
    government became more bureaucratic in its form, and more concentrated
    into the hand of Napoleon, infinitely subdivided, and the head of each
    subdivision had a seat in the Council of State. By this arrangement
    the Emperor was able to keep a check on his ministers, and to prevent
    the administration from being thrown out of gear by the death or
    retirement of a single man. Nevertheless, the ministries, as in all
    highly organised states, were of vast importance, and Napoleon was
    fortunate in the men he placed at their head. It is worthy of note that
    three of the ministers who had served him during the Consulate remained
    in office throughout the Empire, namely, Gaudin, afterwards created
    Duke of Gaeta, Minister of Finance, who had several assistants in the
    Council of State, of whom the most notable were Defermon, a former
    deputy in the Constituent Assembly and the Convention, and Louis;
    Decrès, also created a duke, Minister of the Marine; and Regnier, Duke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
    of Massa and Grand Judge, Minister of Justice. At the War Office,
    the Emperor retained his chief of the staff, Marshal Berthier, until
    1807, when he was succeeded by General Clarke, Duke of Feltre; and the
    various sections were presided over by able administrators, of whom the
    best were perhaps Lacuée de Cessac and Daru. At the Foreign Office,
    Talleyrand remained supreme until after the Treaty of Tilsit, in 1807,
    when he was replaced by Champagny, Duke of Cadore, who in his turn
    gave way to Maret, Duke of Bassano. At the Ministry of the Interior a
    change was made at the beginning of the Empire by the retirement of
    Chaptal, who had held that post with singular distinction throughout
    the Consulate, and the appointment of Champagny. But this department
    was overshadowed by the existence of the Ministry of General Police.
    Napoleon abolished this office in 1803, in the hope, doubtless, of
    dispensing with the services of Fouché; but that astute minister was a
    necessity, and in 1804 he was again appointed to his old office, which
    he held until 1810.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Camp at Boulogne.</div>

  <p>In the midst of the <i>fêtes</i> which accompanied his acceptance of the
    Empire, Napoleon did not forget that he was engaged in war with
    England. He declared that as he had crossed the Alps, so, too, he
    could cross the Channel. For this purpose he collected a flotilla of
    flat-bottomed boats at Boulogne, and encamped picked soldiers from
    the Armies of the Rhine and of Italy upon the coast. But he felt that
    it would be impossible for his flotilla to cross the Channel while
    the English fleets were masters of the sea. He therefore determined
    to unite the two French fleets, which were concentrated at Toulon and
    Brest, and summoned his allies, the Dutch and the Spaniards, to prepare
    fleets also. He kept 120,000 veterans continually at work practising
    embarkation and disembarkation, and it was commonly believed, not
    only in Europe, but in England itself, that the invasion would be
    carried into effect. The army was equipped in a very thorough fashion,
    and carefully organised as the Grand Army under the most experienced
    generals in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span> France, and it became one of the most efficient fighting
    machines ever known in the history of the world, its discipline being
    perfect and its enthusiasm unbounded.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Villeneuve’s Failure.</div>

  <p>While making these preparations for the invasion of England, Napoleon
    struck at other more accessible branches of the British power. In 1803
    he occupied Hanover, the hereditary dominion of George <span class="smcap">III.</span>,
    in spite of its being covered by the Prussian line of demarcation. In
    1804 he sent a division into the kingdom of Naples, in order to close
    the Neapolitan ports to English trade; and once more he threatened
    Portugal. He also endeavoured to stir up a maritime foe to the English,
    and sold to the United States the province of Louisiana, which he had
    annexed from Spain, in the hope of obtaining their alliance. It was
    only necessary for Napoleon to be master of the Channel for a few
    hours, and to have a fine day, for his project of invading England to
    succeed. According to his instructions, Admiral Villeneuve left Toulon
    in March 1805, eluded Nelson, joined the Spanish fleet, and made his
    way to the West Indies, where he expected to meet the fleet from Brest.
    But the Brest fleet could not break through the blockade; Villeneuve
    had to return, and, after an action with an English squadron under Sir
    Robert Calder on 22nd July, he put into Ferrol. At Napoleon’s command,
    the admiral set out for Brest on 11th August, but meeting with bad
    weather, he lost heart and sailed away to Cadiz. Thus foiled in his
    great scheme for bringing up an overpowering French fleet to cover his
    invading army, Napoleon dared not leave the harbour of Boulogne.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Pitt’s New Coalition. 1805.</div>

  <p>While threatened by the Boulogne flotilla, the English Government did
    all in its power to raise enemies on the Continent against Napoleon.
    Prussia, as usual, insisted on her neutrality; but Russia and Austria
    were not unwilling to try their strength once more with France. The
    Emperor Alexander of Russia was personally inclined to admire Napoleon,
    but he was induced by his Court, his family, and his ministry, who
    pointed out to him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span> the importance of remaining on good terms with
    England, to sign an alliance with Pitt; he was further profoundly
    irritated by the violent scene which Napoleon, as First Consul, had had
    with his ambassador, Count Morkov, and was horrified at the execution
    of the Duc d’Enghien. The Emperor Francis of Austria was even more
    willing to fight Napoleon. He had spent the period of peace since the
    Treaty of Lunéville in reorganising his army, and believed that he
    would be more successful now that he was freed from the incubus of his
    position as Holy Roman Emperor. The State Chancellor, Cobenzl, was also
    keenly in favour of war, for he was a sincere believer in the might of
    Russia, and had imbibed a desire to please the Court of St. Petersburg,
    at which he had long held the post of Austrian ambassador. To induce
    these powerful allies to attack in force, Pitt, who was once more
    Prime Minister, did not grudge the wealth of England. Large subsidies
    were offered both to Russia and Austria, which supplied the means for
    commencing the campaign; and strenuous efforts were made to win the
    assistance of Prussia.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Outbreak of War.</div>

  <p>In the second line, Pitt counted on the assistance of Sweden and
    Naples. Napoleon’s promptitude in invading the latter country destroyed
    any chance of its effecting a diversion in Italy, and Gustavus
    <span class="smcap">IV.</span> of Sweden, though, like his father, a violent enemy of
    France, was unable to bring any active assistance, while Prussia
    remained neutral. A pretext for war was found in the annexation of
    Lucca and Genoa to the French Empire, and the Austrians and Russians
    resolved to strike at once. General Mack, with a powerful Austrian
    force, invaded Bavaria before the declaration of war, and, by the
    occupation of Ulm, he believed he had secured the valley of the
    Danube. Meanwhile the principal Austrian army of 120,000 men, under
    the Archduke Charles, invaded Italy, and a powerful force of Russians
    kept close to the Prussian frontier, in the hope of inducing Prussia to
    declare war against France.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Battle of Trafalgar. 21st Oct. 1805.</div>

  <p>Napoleon, despairing of success in his projected invasion of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span> England,
    resolved to turn promptly upon England’s principal ally, and directed
    the Grand Army to break up from Boulogne and enter Germany. Mack
    regarded it as certain that the French, as in the campaigns of Moreau,
    would advance through the Black Forest. Napoleon encouraged his
    illusion by showing him a few French troops in that quarter. Meanwhile,
    the Grand Army advanced in two portions through Würtemburg and
    Franconia, and, on reaching the Danube, after violating the Prussian
    neutrality by marching through Anspach, cut off Mack’s retreat on
    Vienna. The Austrian general made an effort to break through the French
    army, but he was defeated by Ney at Elchingen, and surrendered on the
    20th of October 1805 with 33,000 men. The capitulation of Ulm did more
    than deprive Austria of a serviceable army,—it left open the road to
    Vienna. Napoleon rapidly followed up his success. He marched past a
    united Russian and Austrian army, which was quartered in Moravia, to
    influence Prussia, occupied Vienna, crossed the Danube, and eventually
    faced the army of the two emperors at Austerlitz. On the 2d of December
    1805, the anniversary of his coronation, the Grand Army utterly
    defeated the Austrians and Russians. The allies lost 15,000 men killed
    and wounded, 20,000 prisoners, and 189 guns; and the Emperor Francis
    found himself defenceless, for his only other army, that in Italy,
    had been defeated at Caldiero by Eugène de Beauharnais and Masséna on
    the 30th of October. While the rapid campaign of Austerlitz,—perhaps
    the most glorious of Napoleon’s military career,—was taking place, he
    lost the navy which he had prepared with so much care, and which had
    been intended to cover his invasion of England. The French admiral,
    Villeneuve, left Cadiz at the head of the united French and Spanish
    fleet, consisting of thirty-three ships of the line and five frigates.
    He had not gone far when he was met by Nelson at the head of the
    English squadron of twenty-seven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span> ships off Cape Trafalgar. The victory
    of Trafalgar, which was won on the 21st of October, was as complete
    as that of Austerlitz. The French and Spanish fleet was as entirely
    destroyed as the Austrian and Russian army. The allies at Trafalgar
    lost 7000 men in killed and wounded, and the English only 3000, among
    whom, however, was Nelson himself.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Treaty of Pressburg. 26th Dec. 1805.</div>

  <p>The result of the battle of Austerlitz was the Treaty of Pressburg,
    which was signed by Austria and France on the 26th of December 1805.
    The Russians had only lost one army, and their territory had not been
    invaded, so that they were still enabled to remain in arms. But Austria
    was completely crushed. By the Treaty of Pressburg, Venice, Istria, and
    Dalmatia were ceded to the Kingdom of Italy; but Napoleon kept the two
    latter provinces under his direct rule, and gave the command of them to
    General Marmont. The Tyrol and part of Swabia were ceded to Bavaria,
    and the Elector of that State took the title of King. The same title
    was conferred on the Duke of Würtemburg; the Duke of Baden became a
    Grand Duke; many small German principalities were suppressed, and, on
    12th of July 1806, the Confederation of the Rhine was formed under the
    protectorate of the French Emperor. England could not blame Austria
    for making a separate treaty with France, for she herself had been
    saved from invasion by the departure of the Grand Army from Boulogne,
    not less than by the victory of Trafalgar. The news of Austerlitz was
    followed on the 23d of January 1806 by the death of Pitt, and the new
    English ministry of Fox and Grenville, now that the fear of invasion
    was over, desired to enter into negotiations with Napoleon.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Overthrow of Prussia.</div>

  <p>The overthrow of Austria was followed by the overthrow of Prussia.
    Frederick William <span class="smcap">III.</span> had prided himself on the manner in
    which, in spite of many temptations, he had maintained his attitude of
    strict neutrality. Neither the offers of the Directory or of Napoleon,
    nor the subsidies lavishly promised by England, had been able to
    disturb his determination. The Prussian ministry proudly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span> pointed to
    the fact that, while the rest of Europe had been torn by disastrous
    wars, Prussia had remained at peace ever since the Treaty of Basle
    in 1795. She had profited by her peace policy as much as France and
    Austria by their war policy. The rearrangement of Germany in 1803 had
    converted Prussia from a collection of scattered states into a united
    kingdom. She had even, up to the year 1803, maintained the freedom of
    the whole of the north of Germany from the terrible French invaders
    by the observation of the line of demarcation settled in 1795. The
    northern states of Germany looked to Prussia as their leader, and since
    the destruction of the Holy Roman Empire the Prussian policy had been
    completely victorious over the Austrian. The maintenance of the line
    of demarcation was the favourite scheme of the Prussian King, and as
    long as it was observed, nothing short of invasion would have disturbed
    his neutrality. But the occupation of Hanover in 1803, as one of the
    measures taken by Napoleon against England, had infringed the line
    of demarcation, and from that moment Frederick William <span class="smcap">III.</span>
    inclined towards war.</p>

  <p>In this warlike attitude he was encouraged by Russia and England,
    and still more by his own army. The Prussian army, the creation of
    Frederick the Great, represented in more than an ordinary fashion the
    Prussian nation. Relying on the recollections of the Seven Years’
    War, and confident in the proverbial discipline of their soldiers,
    the Prussian generals believed that they would be able to defeat the
    conquerors of the rest of Europe. With the utmost ardour the young
    Prussian noblemen shouted for war; they resented the long peace, and
    applauded the new attitude of the king. He was stimulated likewise by
    the hatred for France, which was openly encouraged by his beautiful
    Queen Louisa, and he met with opposition only from a few of his more
    experienced ministers, and from the old Duke of Brunswick, who well
    knew the excellence of the French troops. Undecided and hesitating,
    Frederick William refused to join the coalition of Austria and
    Russia in 1805, when his assistance would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span> been of the greatest
    service. He signed, indeed, the Treaty of Potsdam on 3d November 1805,
    undertaking to mediate, and to join the coalition with 180,000 men if
    Napoleon refused the terms he offered. But the proposed intervention
    came to nothing. Haugwitz, the Prussian minister, awaited at Napoleon’s
    headquarters the result of the battle of Austerlitz, and on December
    15 he signed the Treaty of Schönbrunn, by which Prussia ceded Cleves
    to France and Anspach to Bavaria, and received provisional possession
    of Hanover. Two months later, on February 15, Prussia was compelled by
    a supplementary treaty to definitely accept Hanover from Napoleon, an
    arrangement which was tantamount to declaring war with England.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Campaign of Jena. Oct. 1806.</div>

  <p>The long neutrality of Frederick William <span class="smcap">III.</span> was thus broken,
    and, as it soon appeared, in vain. For Napoleon almost immediately
    offered to restore Hanover to England, with which country he was
    induced to enter into negotiations for peace by the accession of Fox
    to office. At this news Frederick William mobilised his troops and
    prepared for war with France. In October 1806 he ordered the victor of
    Austerlitz to at once retire behind the Rhine, and slowly concentrated
    his army in Thuringia without waiting for the succour promised by the
    Russians. The Prussian officers applauded their king’s conduct, for
    they desired to have the glory of defeating the French entirely to
    themselves. On the 14th of October 1806 the two corps of the Prussian
    army, which were advancing along the river Saale, were defeated by
    Napoleon himself at Jena, and by Marshal Davout at Auerstädt. The
    triumph was as complete as that of Austerlitz; and on the 25th the
    French army entered Berlin.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Campaign of Eylau.</div>

  <p>It was now necessary for the Grand Army to attack the Russians.
    Napoleon, after occupying nearly the whole of Prussia and laying siege
    to Dantzic, entered Poland. He was received with an enthusiastic
    welcome by the Poles, whose independence he hinted at restoring. Polish
    troops had long served in his armies,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span> and the sympathy of the French
    people for the oppressed Poles was known throughout Poland. On the 15th
    of December 1806 Napoleon occupied Warsaw and sent his army into winter
    quarters upon the Russian frontier. The Russian general, Benningsen,
    one of the murderers of the Emperor Paul, conceived the idea of
    surprising part of the French army in its winter quarters. He drove
    back the division of Bernadotte; but when he reached the neighbourhood
    of Königsberg he found that Napoleon had received information of his
    movement and had collected the bulk of his army. It was now Napoleon’s
    turn to pursue the Russians. At the head of 60,000 men he found 80,000
    Russians intrenched in the village of Eylau, and attacked them during
    a snowstorm on the 8th of February 1807. The battle was long disputed.
    The Russians had to retire, but it was estimated that the loss of both
    armies was about the same, namely, 35,000 men. This loss was far more
    severe to the French than to the Russians, for the French soldiers
    slain at Eylau were veterans of the Grand Army, and their place could
    only be taken by raw conscripts.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Battle of Friedland. 14th June 1807.</div>

  <p>The result of the battle of Eylau was to allow the French army to
    remain undisturbed in its winter quarters. In the Russian camp,
    meanwhile, important diplomatic negotiations had been going on.
    Frederick William cemented his friendship with the Emperor Alexander,
    and appointed the most able of his servants, Hardenberg, to be State
    Chancellor in the place of Haugwitz. Prussia could indeed give but
    little real help, for her army was destroyed, and her country almost
    entirely in the hands of the French; but Alexander, nevertheless,
    consented in April 1807 to sign the Treaty of Bartenstein with
    Frederick William, by which they formed an offensive and defensive
    alliance. But the hopes of the diplomatists, founded on the drawn
    battle of Eylau, were soon to be frustrated by the military successes
    of Napoleon. On the 24th of May 1807 Dantzic, which had withstood a
    desperate siege, surrendered to General Lefebvre, and the besieging
    troops were able to join the main army.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span> The summer campaign of 1807
    was very short. Benningsen, accompanied by the Emperor Alexander in
    person, advanced to attack the French army on the 14th of June. The
    Russians foolishly crossed the Alle at Friedland, and with the river
    at their back were completely defeated with a loss of 25,000 men. The
    victory of Friedland was decisive; it did not destroy the Russian
    Empire, as the victories of Austerlitz and Jena had destroyed the
    Austrian Empire and the Prussian Kingdom; it did not extinguish the
    fighting power of Russia; it did not diminish the <i>morale</i> of the
    Russian army, which proudly boasted that it had made a better stand
    against the French than either the Austrians or the Prussians. It was
    not positively necessary for the very existence of his monarchy that
    the Emperor Alexander should treat with Napoleon, but his successive
    defeats justified him before his Court and his ministers in demanding
    peace. He could reply to their arguments in favour of an English
    alliance for Russia that he had loyally tried to carry out the terms of
    that alliance, but that under the circumstances he could maintain it no
    longer. He had always wished for peace with France and the friendship
    of Napoleon; he now considered himself free to follow his personal
    inclinations.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Interview at Tilsit, 25th June 1807.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Peace of Tilsit, 7th July 1807.</div>

  <p>On the 25th of June 1807 the Emperor of the French and the Czar of
    Russia had their famous interview at Tilsit on a raft moored in the
    middle of the river Niemen. The personal magnetism of Napoleon and his
    glory as a great conqueror powerfully impressed the vivid imagination
    of Alexander, who had always felt the warmest admiration for him.
    During this interview Napoleon spread before the eyes of the Emperor
    of Russia his favourite conception of the re-establishment of the
    old Empires of the East and of the West. They were to be faithful
    allies. France was to be the supreme power over the Latin races and
    in the centre of Europe; Russia was to represent the Greek Empire
    and to expand into Asia. These grandiose views charmed the Emperor
    Alexander, who believed that in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span> adopting them he was following out
    the policy of Peter the Great and of the Empress Catherine. The
    one enemy to be feared and to be crushed according to Napoleon was
    England. And Alexander, in spite of the loss which his subjects would
    suffer, promised to enter into Napoleon’s policy for the exclusion of
    England’s commerce from the Continent, and to accept the doctrine of
    the Continental Blockade. But, at the same time, Alexander did not
    dare to go so far as to promise to declare war against England, in
    spite of the pressure put upon him by Napoleon. The first interview at
    Tilsit was followed by others, and eventually by the Peace of Tilsit.
    By this treaty Russia ceded the Ionian Islands and the mouths of the
    river Cattaro in the south of Dalmatia, which had been occupied by
    the Russians since 1799, to France. Napoleon, on his part, promised
    that he would not restore the independence of Poland, and advised
    Alexander to obtain compensation for the growth of the power of France
    from Sweden and from Turkey. In pursuance of this policy a division of
    the French army invaded Swedish Pomerania and took Stralsund, while
    the Russians occupied Finland. Alexander was pressed by Napoleon to
    invade Turkey, and was promised the assistance of France in obtaining
    the cession of the Danubian principalities. The Emperor of Russia made
    loyal efforts to obtain a favourable peace for his ally, the King of
    Prussia. But Napoleon, though willing to humour Alexander, and desirous
    of making Russia his firm ally, did not hesitate to show his contempt
    for Frederick William <span class="smcap">III.</span> He thought for a time of entirely
    extinguishing Prussia, but on the representations of Alexander he
    contented himself by taking possession of the Rhenish and Westphalian
    provinces of Prussia, and forming them with the principality of
    Hesse-Cassel into the kingdom of Westphalia. He also included Prussian
    Poland in his new Grand Duchy of Warsaw.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Continental Blockade.</div>

  <p>The Peace of Tilsit left Napoleon face to face with only one enemy, and
    that was England. The destruction of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span> French fleet at Trafalgar
    and the diminution of the strength of the Grand Army from the losses
    suffered at Austerlitz, Jena, and Eylau, proved to the Emperor of the
    French that he had better abandon his project of invading England.
    But if he could not cross the Channel in force or meet the English
    fleets at sea, he believed he could ruin England by excluding her
    from the markets of the Continent. The English ministry, in pursuance
    of its reading of international law, had closed all neutral seaborne
    commerce from the mouth of the Elbe to the extremity of the French
    coast. Napoleon answered this measure by his Berlin Decree, which was
    issued in that city on the 21st of November 1806, and declared the
    British Islands to be in a state of blockade. All English merchandise
    was to be confiscated, as well as all ships which had touched either
    at a British port or at a port in the British Colonies. He followed
    up this measure by the Milan Decree of the 17th of December 1807, by
    which he declared that any ship of any country which had touched at a
    British port was liable to be seized and treated as prize. The entry
    of Russia into the scheme of the Continental Blockade would, Napoleon
    hoped, entirely ruin the English trade. But, in reality, it did nothing
    of the sort. English commerce was as active and enterprising as ever,
    and the risks it encountered in running the Continental Blockade only
    increased the profits of the English merchants. The real sufferers were
    the inhabitants of the Continent, who had to pay enhanced prices for
    such articles of prime necessity as sugar. Napoleon’s expectation that
    the carrying trade of the world would desert England and fall into the
    hands of France and her allies was not fulfilled, because the English
    war fleets remained complete masters of the sea, and effectually
    prevented the rise of any other commercial power. The result of the
    Continental Blockade was therefore the impoverishment of the allies
    of France and their consequent hatred of Napoleon, while it increased
    rather than diminished the commercial prosperity of England.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span></p>

  <div class="sidenote">Bombardment of Copenhagen. Sept. 1807.</div>

  <p>The English ministers were not afraid of Napoleon’s Continental
    Blockade. But his occupation of Northern Germany made them fear that
    his next step would be to seize the Danish fleet as the Directory had
    in former days appropriated the Dutch fleet. Secret stipulations were
    indeed made at Tilsit, by virtue of which the Danish fleet was to be
    seized by France. Information of this scheme was given to the English
    ministers, and a secret expedition was planned to prevent its being
    carried into effect. Denmark was a neutral nation, and had given no
    pretext for war to either France or England. But Denmark was a weak
    nation and unable to defend itself. Under these circumstances the
    English struck first. A powerful expedition anchored before Copenhagen
    in September 1807; the city was bombarded; the small Danish army
    was defeated at Kioge by a division under the command of Sir Arthur
    Wellesley; and the whole Danish fleet was appropriated or destroyed by
    England. By this rapid blow one of Napoleon’s most cherished schemes
    came to nought, and his hope of getting another serviceable navy
    effectually extinguished.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">French Invasion of Portugal. 1807.</div>

  <p>The two most faithful allies of England were the small kingdoms of
    Portugal and Sweden. The Russians were left to deal with the latter;
    Napoleon resolved to attack the former himself. The French Emperor,
    like the Directory before him, insisted on regarding Portugal as an
    outlying province of England, and, indeed, there was some ground for
    this view, as owing to the Methuen Treaty the relations between the two
    countries were very close. Yet the Prince Regent of Portugal in 1806
    had declined to declare himself the open ally of England, and insisted
    on the maintenance of his position of neutrality. Nevertheless,
    Napoleon resolved to ruin Portugal because the Prince Regent declined
    to become a party to the Continental Blockade. He at first resolved to
    act with Spain as he had done in 1801, and on the 29th of October 1807
    the Treaty of Fontainebleau was signed, by which it was agreed that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
    the combined armies of France and Spain should conquer Portugal. The
    little kingdom was then to be divided into three parts; the northern
    provinces were to be given to the King of Etruria in exchange for
    his dominions in Italy which Napoleon desired to annex; the southern
    districts were to be formed into an independent kingdom for Godoy,
    the Prince of the Peace, the lover of the Queen of Spain, and the
    most powerful man in that kingdom; and the central portion was to be
    temporarily held by France. In pursuance of this secret treaty a French
    army under General Junot marched rapidly across the Peninsula, and
    on the news that it was close to Lisbon, the Prince Regent, with his
    mother, the mad queen, Maria <span class="smcap">I.</span>, and his two sons sailed for
    Brazil with an English squadron. Hardly had the Regent left the Tagus
    when Junot entered Lisbon on the 20th of November 1807. The French were
    favourably received in Portugal. The Portuguese resented the departure
    of the Prince Regent; democratic principles had made considerable
    progress; and no idea was entertained that there was a secret design to
    dismember the kingdom. Junot had little difficulty in occupying almost
    the whole of Portugal; he sent the picked troops of the Portuguese
    army under the name of the Portuguese Legion to join the Grand Army
    in Germany; and he promised a Constitution to the country. On the 1st
    of February 1808 he issued a proclamation that the House of Braganza
    had ceased to reign, and after the fortresses had been surrendered he
    proceeded to administer Portugal as a conquered country.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Sweden.</div>

  <p>Gustavus <span class="smcap">IV.</span> of Sweden, who had taken the power into his own
    hands from his uncle the Regent Duke of Sudermania and had married
    the sister-in-law of the Emperor Alexander of Russia, in 1797, had
    inherited the hatred for France, which had been, after 1789, one of the
    guiding principles of his father, Gustavus <span class="smcap">III.</span> He had been
    the ready ally of England in all the coalitions against both the French
    Directory and Napoleon, and after the rupture of the Peace of Amiens
    in 1803, he became the key-stone of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span> Anglo-Russian alliance. In
    1805 he promised to place himself at the head of an English, Russian,
    and Swedish army which was to invade Hanover, and occupy Holland; but
    he failed to set sail on the appointed day, and caused the expedition
    to lead to no result. Nevertheless, he remained faithful to England,
    and at the time of the Treaty of Tilsit refused to abandon the English
    alliance. As has been already said, Swedish Pomerania was occupied by
    a division of the Grand Army, under Marshal Brune, and Sweden never
    recovered the ancient conquest of Gustavus Adolphus. In 1808, on the
    obstinate refusal of the Swedish King to accede to the Continental
    Blockade, the Emperor Alexander, as had been agreed at Tilsit, invaded
    Finland. England was ready to assist Sweden, and a powerful army, under
    Sir John Moore, was sent to Stockholm. At this crisis the King showed
    signs of insanity. The English expedition retired, and at the beginning
    of 1809 Gustavus <span class="smcap">IV.</span> was dethroned.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Rearrangement of Europe.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Holland.</div>

  <p>After he had made himself Emperor, and still more after his victories
    over Austria and Prussia and his alliance with Russia, Napoleon
    began to assure his power on the Continent by establishing vassal
    kings in the neighbourhood of France. Just as the French Directory
    had surrounded the French Republic with smaller republics governed
    after its own model, so Napoleon surrounded his frontiers with
    subject kingdoms. The Batavian, the Cisalpine, and the Parthenopean
    Republics were succeeded by the kingdoms of Holland and of Naples
    and the vice-royalty of Italy. The form of the Batavian Republic
    had altered with every change in the Constitution of France. From a
    democratic Republic in the time of the Convention it had become a
    Directory and a Consulate, and in 1805, after the French Empire had
    been established, it received a new Constitution. By this arrangement
    Count Schimmelpenninck, a distinguished Dutch statesman, was appointed
    Grand Pensionary for life, but in June 1806 he was induced to resign,
    and Louis Bonaparte, the favourite brother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span> of the French Emperor,
    was made King of Holland. The Dutch people had no objection to these
    changes. The introduction of the French system of administration
    consolidated the country from a group of federal states into a united
    nation. Its trade prospered, though it lost its fleet at Camperdown
    in 1797, and in the Texel in 1799, and it became more wealthy than
    ever, in spite of the conquest of all its colonies by England, by the
    close communication established with Paris and the abolition of the
    vexatious transit-duties in Belgium. Louis Bonaparte, the first King of
    Holland, showed himself a sagacious monarch. He caused the Civil Code
    to be introduced into his dominions in the place of the old cumbrous
    system of Dutch law. He encouraged literature and art, and he moved
    the capital from the Hague to Amsterdam. But the introduction of the
    Continental Blockade caused profound discontent. The Dutch merchants
    were ruined by its rigorous application; riots took place in many
    districts; and since Napoleon found the Continental Blockade was being
    evaded he caused French troops to enter Holland and occupy the mouths
    of the rivers. Louis Bonaparte protested against this conduct, and in
    1810 he resigned the crown which his brother had given him.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Naples.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Illyria.</div>

  <p>It has been said that when Napoleon made himself Emperor he likewise
    assumed the title of King of Italy, and that he did not undertake the
    government, but conferred it upon his step-son, Eugène de Beauharnais,
    as Viceroy. The original Kingdom of Italy only comprehended the
    dominions of the Cisalpine Republic,—that is to say, Lombardy, the
    Duchies of Modena and Parma, and the former Papal Legations of Bologna
    and Ferrara. By the Treaty of Pressburg in 1806 the Kingdom of Italy
    was increased by the addition of Venice and of the former Venetian
    territories on the mainland. Genoa, Lucca, Piedmont, and Tuscany,
    were, however, directly administered by France, and the city of Rome
    and the Campagna was added to the French Empire in the year 1810.
    In the south<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span> of the Italian peninsula Naples was erected into an
    independent kingdom, which was intended to include the island of
    Sicily. This kingdom was conferred upon the elder brother of Napoleon,
    Joseph Bonaparte, on the 30th of March 1806. Joseph, like King Louis
    of Holland, tried to act as a good king. He formed an able ministry,
    consisting almost entirely of Neapolitans, and containing but two
    Frenchmen,—Miot de Melito, Minister of War, and Saliceti, Minister
    of Police. He introduced good laws, and made efforts to put down the
    brigandage which ravaged the southern districts of his kingdom. The
    island of Sicily meanwhile resisted all the attempts of the French.
    It acknowledged the rule of Ferdinand, King of the Two Sicilies, who
    had retired to Palermo, and it was garrisoned by an English army. This
    army kept Joseph in perpetual embarrassment. The English encouraged the
    brigands of Calabria, and in the summer of 1806 they made a descent
    upon the mainland, and on the 3d of July the English general, Sir John
    Stuart, defeated the French general Reynier at Maida. This victory,
    however, was followed by the capitulation of Gaeta on the 18th of
    July, after which event the French army in Calabria was strengthened
    to such an extent that the English were unable to do more than defend
    Sicily. The internal administration of Joseph Bonaparte deserves every
    praise; he abolished feudalism; he endeavoured to introduce honesty and
    uprightness in the collection of the taxes; he declared the equality of
    all citizens before the law; and by the suppression of many monasteries
    he improved the finances of the country and largely increased the
    number of peasant proprietors. Lastly, must be noticed the Illyrian
    provinces of Dalmatia and Istria, which had been ceded by the Treaty
    of Pressburg. They were directly administered by General Marmont, who
    reported to Napoleon himself and not to the Viceroy of Italy. After
    the Treaty of Tilsit they were augmented by the Ionian Islands, and
    Napoleon kept a powerful army in this quarter to threaten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span> the Turks.
    It is probable, indeed, that he dreamt of restoring the independence of
    Greece, and his Illyrian army was well placed for carrying out such a
    project.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Napoleon’s Reorganisation of Germany.</div>

  <p>In his rearrangement of the states of Germany and of the balance
    of power in Central Europe, Napoleon, like the Directory, followed
    out the traditional policy of Richelieu and Mazarin. He held it to
    be an advantage for France that there should be a number of small
    German states between the Rhine and the hereditary dominions of
    the House of Austria, but he considered that the very small size
    of the states maintained by the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648 made
    them inadequate buffers. He, therefore, enlarged the Western German
    states and endeavoured to unite their interests with those of France.
    The reconstitution of Germany after the Peace of Lunéville in 1803
    destroyed the old Holy Roman Empire. Napoleon worked on the same
    lines, and his measures have had almost the same permanence as the
    arrangements of 1803. The changes took place gradually in accordance
    with the Treaties of Pressburg and of Tilsit, but their final results
    may be considered as a whole.</p>

  <p>Maximilian Joseph, the Elector of Bavaria, had, by hereditary right,
    united the Electorates of the Palatinate and of Bavaria with the Duchy
    of Deux-Ponts. He had been educated at the Court of Versailles, but
    nevertheless he approved of the doctrines of the French Revolution and
    became one of the earliest allies of Napoleon. The arrangements after
    the Treaty of Lunéville, which had deprived him of the Palatinate and
    of the Duchy of Deux-Ponts, had given him a powerful and concentrated
    state. By the Treaty of Pressburg he received in addition the Tyrol
    and the cities of Nuremberg and Ratisbon with the title of King. In
    1809 he further received the Principality of Salzburg, which made his
    kingdom one of the most powerful in Germany. Possessing the whole of
    the upper valley of the Danube, and the valleys of its affluents,
    Bavaria formed a strong frontier state against Austria, and to the
    north marched with the kingdom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span> of Saxony. King Maximilian Joseph
    felt that he owed his power to the French Emperor, and to seal the
    friendship he gave his daughter, the Princess Augusta, in marriage
    to Napoleon’s step-son, the Viceroy Eugène de Beauharnais. On the
    western frontier of Bavaria, in order to check that state if it became
    too powerful, Napoleon erected the smaller kingdom of Würtemberg.
    Frederick, Duke of Würtemberg, like Maximilian Joseph of Bavaria,
    had shown himself ready to recognise the authority of the French
    Republic and of Napoleon. He had received considerable additions to his
    territories with the title of Elector in 1803, and after the Treaty of
    Pressburg he received the whole of Austrian Suabia except the Breisgau
    and Ortenau with the title of King. He, too, like the first King of
    Bavaria, entered into a personal alliance with Napoleon, and gave his
    daughter, the Princess Catherine, in marriage to Jerome Bonaparte,
    King of Westphalia. The third south German state which deserves notice
    is Baden, whose Duke, Charles Frederick, was made an Elector in 1803,
    and in 1805 received the title of Grand Duke with the greater part
    of Ortenau and the Breisgau from Austrian Suabia. He, too, formed a
    family alliance with Napoleon by the marriage of his heir to Stéphanie
    de Beauharnais, Napoleon’s step-daughter. The kingdom of Westphalia,
    which was formed by Napoleon for his brother Jerome after the Treaty
    of Tilsit, was an entirely new creation, not an enlargement of a
    former German state like Bavaria and Würtemberg. It consisted of the
    Electorate of Hesse-Cassel, the Prussian territories on the left of
    the Elbe, including the bishoprics of Paderborn and Hildesheim, the
    Old Mark of Brandenburg, etc., the Duchy of Brunswick, a portion of
    Hanover, and other scattered districts. It thus contained the greater
    part of the valleys of the Ems, the Weser, and the Oder, but it did not
    reach the sea, and its only important fortress was Magdeburg. Jerome,
    who was appointed its first king, was not such a capable monarch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span> as
    his brothers Joseph and Louis, but he formed an able ministry, of which
    the most conspicuous members were Siméon, the famous French jurist,
    as Minister of Justice, and the historian, Johann Müller as Minister
    of Public Instruction. The Westphalian people did not amalgamate so
    thoroughly as Napoleon had expected; but this was not the fault of
    Jerome’s ministry, which abolished feudalism, introduced the Civil
    Code, and regularised the administration. The Grand Duchy of Berg,
    which he granted to his brother-in-law Murat in 1806, was another
    creation of Napoleon. It was formed out of the Duchy of Berg ceded by
    Bavaria, the County of the Mark and the Bishopric of Münster, detached
    from Prussia, and of the Duchy of Nassau. It formed a compact little
    state of a million inhabitants, commanding part of the course of the
    Rhine, with its capital at Düsseldorf. The key-stone of Napoleon’s
    policy in Eastern Germany was Saxony. The Elector of that state had
    taken part with the Prussians in the campaign of Jena, but Napoleon
    nevertheless calculated that the ruler of Saxony, placed as he was
    between Prussia and Austria, must naturally be an ally of France. He,
    therefore, in spite of his behaviour in 1806, gave the Elector of
    Saxony the title of King and the Circle of Lower Lusatia. After the
    Treaty of Tilsit Napoleon did yet more for the King of Saxony, whom he
    created likewise Grand Duke of Warsaw. Of the smaller states of Germany
    maintained by Napoleon, the most important was Hesse-Darmstadt which
    separated the kingdom of Westphalia from the Grand Duchy of Berg. As
    a faithful ally of Napoleon, the Landgrave Louis <span class="smcap">X.</span> received
    some accessions of territory with the title of Grand Duke. The fourth
    Grand Duchy after Baden, Berg, and Hesse-Darmstadt, was the Grand
    Duchy of Frankfort. This was conferred upon the Archbishop, Charles
    de Dalberg. This prelate had been coadjutor to the Archbishop-Elector
    of Mayence in the time of the Revolution. He had succeeded to the
    Archbishopric<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span> in 1802, and in 1803, on the reorganisation of Germany,
    was the only ecclesiastical elector retained. He was then given the
    Bishopric of Ratisbon, and when that was transferred to Bavaria, was
    granted instead the Principalities of Fulda and Hanau and the territory
    of Aschaffenburg. The last Grand Duchy was that of Würtzburg, which
    was conferred on the Archduke Ferdinand, the former Grand Duke of
    Tuscany, in exchange for the Principality of Salzburg given to Bavaria
    in 1809. These territorial changes were supplemented by a wholesale
    destruction of the very small states. The Knights of the Empire lost
    their sovereign rights; all the petty dukes and princes whose territory
    was enclosed in the larger states which have been mentioned, were also
    mediatised, that is to say, while retaining their rights as lords
    and their titles, they lost their immediate sovereignty and became a
    sort of privileged aristocracy. This measure, which supplemented the
    arrangements of 1803, finally destroyed the ancient system of Germany.
    The little courts with but few exceptions disappeared, and Germany
    became a collection of powerful states instead of a congeries of feudal
    principalities.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Confederation of the Rhine.</div>

  <p>Napoleon endeavoured to concentrate the power of the German princes as
    a whole by the formation of the Confederation of the Rhine, of which he
    was officially recognised as Protector. The original Confederation of
    the Rhine established in July 1805, consisted of only fifteen princes,
    but after Tilsit it comprised thirty-two. The Arch-Chancellor of the
    new confederation was Charles de Dalberg, the Grand Duke of Frankfort,
    the only ecclesiastic who was acknowledged as a member. It comprised in
    all the four kingdoms of Bavaria, Würtemberg, Westphalia, and Saxony,
    the five grand duchies and twenty-three principalities. Its policy was
    conducted by a Diet sitting at Frankfort composed of two colleges,—the
    College of Kings and the College of Princes. The Confederation of
    the Rhine, which was mainly situated between the Rhine and the Elbe,
    contained a population of twenty million Germans, and was bound by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
    treaty to contribute a hundred and fifty thousand soldiers to the
    armies of Napoleon.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Poland.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Grand Duchy of Warsaw.</div>

  <p>In no respect did Napoleon prove how thoroughly his idea of
    re-establishing the ancient Empires of the East and the West had taken
    possession of his imagination than in his treatment of Poland. In order
    to please the Emperor Alexander he did not insist upon re-establishing
    Polish independence. Not only did he neither dare nor wish to deprive
    Russia of her Polish provinces, but at Tilsit he even ceded to
    Alexander the two Polish circles of Salkief and Tloczow. But though he
    dared not establish a powerful independent Poland for fear of offending
    Russia, he nevertheless formed, in 1807, a small Polish state under the
    name of the Grand Duchy of Warsaw. By this half measure he failed to
    satisfy the Poles, who had looked to him to be the restorer of Polish
    independence, and at the same time offended the Emperor Alexander, who
    disliked the creation of a Polish state of any size or under any form.
    The Grand Duchy of Warsaw eventually contained the whole of Prussian
    and the greater part of Austrian Poland, and was placed under the rule
    of the King of Saxony as Grand Duke of Warsaw, just as in former days
    the Electors of Saxony had been Kings of Poland. In this half-and-half
    policy with regard to Poland was to be found the greatest peril to the
    newly-formed alliance between Alexander and Napoleon.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Conference at Erfurt. Sept. 1808.</div>

  <p>For more than a year the alliance between Russia and France, between
    Alexander and Napoleon, remained the most important fact of European
    polity; but causes of dissension soon arose. On the one hand,
    Alexander resented the existence of the Grand Duchy of Warsaw, and
    felt that his subjects had cause to grumble at the sufferings they
    endured owing to the Continental Blockade; on the other, there were
    not wanting signs that Napoleon’s power had reached its height, and
    was now about to decline. The first symptoms of this decline were his
    quarrel with the Pope and his intervention in the affairs of Spain.
    The first blows struck at his military<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span> superiority were the defeat
    of the French troops in Portugal by Sir Arthur Wellesley at Vimeiro
    and the capitulation of General Dupont to the Spaniards. The Treaty
    of Tilsit marked the true zenith of Napoleon’s power; but in spite of
    the misfortunes he suffered in 1808, and his wanton intervention in
    the affairs of Spain, he still seemed the greatest monarch in Europe.
    Feeling his prestige somewhat affected, and fearing the effect upon the
    mind of his imaginative ally, Napoleon, trusting in the magnetism of
    his presence and his conversation, had recourse to a personal interview
    with Alexander at Erfurt in September 1808. There the two masters of
    Europe discussed the state of affairs; Napoleon soothed Alexander’s
    discontent, and again promised him the Danubian provinces. But the
    full confidence which had been established at Tilsit was not restored
    at Erfurt. Alexander, in spite of his admiration for the person of
    Napoleon, felt distrustful of his policy, and Napoleon deceived himself
    when he thought he had regained his ascendency over the mind of the
    Russian Emperor. The interviews between the two Emperors formed the
    important political side of the Congress of Erfurt; but the features
    which dazzled Europe were the grand <i>fêtes</i>, the pit full of kings
    which listened to Talma, the great French actor, and the obsequiousness
    of the high-born German princes to one who, a few years before but a
    general of the French Republic, was now master of Europe.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> Treaty of Tilsit marked the greatest height of Napoleon’s power in
    Europe; at the Congress of Erfurt he seemed, indeed, to be as powerful
    as at Tilsit; but during the interval he had experienced two serious
    mishaps. The first of which was caused by the fact that England, which
    had hitherto fought the French upon the sea, and had met with only
    slight success in purely military expeditions, began in 1808 a serious
    effort to break the tradition of the invincibility of the French army.</p>

  <p>The last important campaign upon the Continent in which an English
    army had taken part, was in 1793–1795. Since that time many English
    expeditions had been despatched to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span> carry out isolated plans; some of
    these expeditions had been crowned with success, such as Abercromby’s
    and Hutchinson’s reconquest of Egypt in 1801, and Stuart’s brilliant
    little campaign of Maida in 1806; others had been egregious failures,
    notably the Duke of York’s campaign in Holland in 1799, and Lord
    Cathcart’s landing in Hanover in 1805. Confident in their naval
    superiority, the English Ministers, ever since 1795, had paid more
    attention to the military occupation of islands than to the despatch
    of armies to the mainland. Acting on this policy, the English had
    conquered the French West Indies in 1793 and 1795, and again proceeded
    in 1809 to reoccupy those which had been restored to France at the
    Peace of Amiens. When Spain declared herself the ally of France,
    England occupied her chief West Indian possession, the Island of
    Trinidad; when the subjection of Holland to France became manifest,
    England conquered the Cape of Good Hope in 1797, and again after the
    Treaty of Amiens, in 1805. Nor did the English ministers neglect the
    more distant possessions of her various enemies. Ceylon and Java were
    taken from the Dutch in 1796 and 1807 respectively; the Mauritius was
    conquered from France in 1809, and an unsuccessful attempt was made
    to conquer Spanish South America, Monte Video and Buenos Ayres, in
    1806. But England did not confine her policy of attacking islands to
    distant seas; she also established herself firmly in the Mediterranean.
    In 1797 Minorca was taken, in 1801 Malta, and eventually in 1805 an
    English army, as has been said, garrisoned Sicily. The policy of
    Fox was identical with that of Pitt, and favoured small, detached
    expeditions; some of these were failures, like the expedition to South
    America in 1806, and that to Egypt in 1808, but others attained their
    end. Now, however, a new policy began to make way. Instead of isolated
    expeditions and the occupation of islands which could be defended
    by the English fleets, it was resolved once more, as in 1793, to
    disembark a powerful English army on the Continent, and to try military
    conclusions with the French.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Campaign of Vimeiro, 1808.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Convention of Cintra. 30th August 1803.</div>

  <p>In order that England should act effectively on the Continent, it was
    necessary that her army should have a friendly base of operations.
    The failure of the expedition to Bergen in 1799, and of many similar
    expeditions, proved that it was impossible to expect complete success
    when the disembarking army had to fight from the moment of its landing,
    and had to secure its communications with the sea. An opportunity was
    afforded for obtaining such a base of operations as was necessary, by
    an insurrection breaking out in Portugal against the French invaders.
    It has been said that General Junot occupied the whole of Portugal
    without much difficulty, except the northern and southern provinces,
    which were held by Spanish armies. Junot partitioned out the country
    into military governments under French generals, whose oppressive
    behaviour exasperated the people. After the outbreak of the revolution
    against the French in Spain, the Spanish forces in Portugal retired,
    and Oporto at once declared itself independent of France, and elected a
    Junta of Government, headed by the Bishop. Isolated risings took place
    all over the country. Many French officers and soldiers were murdered,
    and the insurgents were punished with the most rigorous cruelty. The
    Junta of Oporto was, however, unable to make head against Junot, for
    the best regular troops of the Portuguese army had been despatched
    to join the Grand Army in Germany. The Junta had therefore to depend
    upon undisciplined militia, and feeling the impossibility of combating
    the French regular troops in the field, applied for help to England.
    This gave the English ministers their opportunity. A force which had
    been collected at Cork, under the command of Lieutenant-General Sir
    Arthur Wellesley, for an expedition to South America, was ordered
    instead to proceed to Portugal. He was joined by some other troops, and
    disembarked at the mouth of the Mondego river. He marched southwards
    towards Lisbon, and defeated a French division at Roriça on the 17th of
    August 1808. After receiving further reinforcements, he was attacked by
    Junot at Vimeiro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span> on the 21st of August, and won a decisive victory.
    On the field of battle Wellesley was superseded by Sir Harry Burrard,
    and he in his turn by Sir Hew Dalrymple. Instead of following up the
    victory, the latter general concluded the Convention of Cintra, by
    which Junot agreed to evacuate Portugal. From a military point of view
    this was a poor sequel to the victory of Vimeiro; from a political
    point of view it was a signal success. Portugal was freed from the
    French as speedily as she had been conquered by them, and England
    thus secured a friendly base of operations. The three generals were
    all recalled, and Sir John Moore took command of the English army. A
    Council of Regency was established, and an English officer, General
    Beresford, was sent to organise a Portuguese army, partly under the
    command of English officers, and wholly paid by the English Government.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Capitulation of Baylen. 20th July 1808.</div>

  <p>The loss of Portugal was the first serious reverse which Napoleon had
    met with from a trained and disciplined army. But at the same time
    he was made to feel the difficulty of overcoming even an unorganised
    national rising, with the very best of troops. It has been mentioned
    that the King of Spain and the Queen’s favourite, Godoy, were partners
    to the Treaty of Fontainebleau, which arranged for the dismemberment
    of Portugal. Spain had been the consistent ally of France ever since
    the Treaty of Basle in 1795, and in the cause of France had lost not
    only the islands of Minorca and Trinidad, but two gallant fleets in
    the naval battles of Cape St. Vincent and Trafalgar. Nevertheless,
    Napoleon deliberately determined to dethrone his faithful ally Charles
    <span class="smcap">IV.</span> It is said that after the expulsion of the Bourbons from
    Naples, Godoy had made overtures for joining the coalition against
    France, but after the victory of Jena the Court of Madrid, if it had
    ever thought of opposing the will of Napoleon, became more obsequious
    than ever. Court intrigues gave the French Emperor the opportunity he
    desired for interfering with the affairs of Spain. The heir to the
    throne, Ferdinand, Prince of the Asturias, hated his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span> mother’s lover,
    Godoy, and for sharing in a plot against the favourite was thrown into
    prison. He appealed for help to Napoleon, and Charles <span class="smcap">IV.</span>,
    his father, on his side also appealed to the French emperor. Napoleon
    began to move his troops across the Pyrenees, and a French army under
    the command of Murat approached Madrid. The King of Spain was rumoured
    to be about to follow the example of the Prince Regent of Portugal, and
    to leave the country. The population of Madrid rose in insurrection
    and maltreated Godoy, who fell into their hands. Charles <span class="smcap">IV.</span>
    then abdicated in favour of his son, who proceeded to France to
    obtain the support of Napoleon. Charles <span class="smcap">IV.</span> and his Queen
    followed Ferdinand, and when the Spanish royal family was assembled
    at Bayonne, Charles <span class="smcap">IV.</span> was induced to cede the crown of
    Spain to Napoleon, who conferred it on his brother Joseph Bonaparte,
    King of Naples, on the 6th of June 1808. But it was one thing to
    proclaim Joseph King of Spain and the Indies; it was another to place
    him in power. The patriotism of the Spanish people was stirred to its
    depths, and the Spaniards declined to accept a new monarch supported
    by French troops. In every quarter insurrections broke out and juntos
    were formed. Appeals were made to England for help, and money, arms,
    ammunition and English officers were disembarked at all the chief
    ports of Spain. In the month of May the mob of Madrid drove out the
    French soldiers of Murat, who had to retire behind the Ebro. But mobs
    and undisciplined militia can never stand against regular troops.
    Marshal Bessières defeated the best Spanish army under the command of
    General Cuesta at Medina del Rio Seco on the 14th of July 1808, and on
    the 20th of July Joseph entered Madrid. Before his arrival at his new
    capital, flying columns had been sent in every direction, and one of
    these on its way to Cadiz met with a serious disaster. This was the
    famous Capitulation of Baylen. The French division of General Dupont
    was surrounded at that place and forced to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span> capitulate. By the terms of
    the Capitulation, Dupont engaged that not only the soldiers under his
    immediate command, but also that two fresh divisions which were coming
    up should surrender. The Capitulation of Baylen deprived Napoleon of
    the services of 18,000 men, but the loss of prestige could not be
    estimated by numbers. The Spanish insurgents were greatly encouraged
    and rose in every quarter; a guerilla warfare was begun, which was
    in the end more fatal to the French army than regular defeats, and
    Napoleon had for the first time to fight a nation in arms. This was
    an exact reversal of the situation of affairs in the wars of the
    French Revolution; at that time it was the French nation in arms which
    defeated the disciplined soldiers of the Continental monarchs; now
    it was the Spanish nation in arms which counteracted the schemes of
    Napoleon. It is almost impossible to estimate the losses experienced
    by the French during the war in the Iberian Peninsula; the defeats
    inflicted on them by the Anglo-Portuguese army accounted for but a
    small portion of this loss; it was the harassing duty of maintaining
    garrisons in every town and almost in every posting-house which
    exhausted the French army.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Napoleon in Spain.</div>

  <p>It need hardly be said that Napoleon was far from expecting such
    disasters as the Capitulation of Baylen and the Convention of Cintra.
    He had been so accustomed to victory that he could not understand
    the change in his affairs. He looked upon these two events as having
    only a temporary importance, and proceeded to the Congress at Erfurt
    with a light heart. Though checked in Spain, he was none the less the
    master in Germany, and the monarchs of Central Europe did not know
    that he had reached his zenith and was about to decline. The Emperor
    Alexander alone seems to have had some suspicion of the truth, for
    he entered into fresh relations with England by means of the strong
    English party at his Court, which was headed by the Empress-mother. As
    soon as the Congress of Erfurt was over, Napoleon proceeded to Spain
    in person, accompanied by his Guard and his most experienced troops,
    and surrounded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span> by his most famous generals. After the Capitulation
    of Baylen, Joseph Bonaparte had left Madrid, and with the bulk of
    the French army had retreated behind the Ebro. He was there joined
    by Napoleon, who had under his command no less than 135,000 men. He
    rapidly advanced upon Madrid; Marshal Soult defeated the Spanish Army
    of the Centre at Burgos on the 10th of November; Marshal Victor the
    Spanish Army of the Left at Espinosa on the 11th of November; and
    Marshal Lannes the Army of the Right at Tudela on the 3d of November.
    In spite of the snow, the Emperor in person forced the pass of the
    Somo Sierra, and on the 13th of December received the capitulation
    of Madrid. The victories of his lieutenants and his own rapid and
    successful advance on the capital, convinced Napoleon that the
    difficulties of the Spanish war had been exaggerated, and the result
    of this impression was that he neglected in after years to strengthen
    his armies in Spain sufficiently, and attributed all failures to the
    incompetence of his generals, instead of to the obstinate tenacity of
    his opponents.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Sir John Moore’s advance.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Battle of Corunna. Jan. 16, 1809.</div>

  <p>After occupying Madrid, the Emperor next determined to turn his
    strength against the English forces in the Peninsula. Sir John Moore,
    who was in command of the English army in Portugal, could not believe
    that the Spanish armies were too weak to face the French; but when he
    heard that Napoleon was at Madrid, he resolved to make a diversion
    in order to prevent him from conquering Andalusia, and to give time
    for the Junta of Seville to organise the defence of that province.
    Leaving a small division to protect Portugal under Sir John Cradock,
    Moore, with the bulk of the English army, invaded north-west Spain and
    advanced as far as Salamanca and Toro. Napoleon, as Moore had expected,
    put off the invasion of Andalusia and turned against the English. Moore
    having thus effected his purpose, then fell back into Galicia. In the
    midst of most terrible weather he effected one of the most famous
    retreats in history, turning occasionally to face his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span> pursuers, and
    fighting several brilliant rear-guard actions. Napoleon conducted the
    pursuit in person for some time, but hearing that Austria was preparing
    for war, he handed over the command to Soult and suddenly returned
    to France. Soult did not come up with the English army until it had
    reached Corunna, and was waiting there to embark. A battle was fought
    to protect the embarkation of the English, in which Sir John Moore was
    killed, and Soult, whose losses during the rapid pursuit had been very
    great, turned southwards to occupy Oporto.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Austria. 1805–1809.</div>

  <p>The Treaty of Pressburg had made a very painful impression, not only
    upon the mind of Francis <span class="smcap">I.</span> of Austria, but also on the
    Austrian people. The indignation aroused by the cession of Dalmatia
    and the loss of Venice, which had been given to the House of Austria
    as compensation for the Milanese, had exasperated the Austrian
    people. But, on the other hand, the Hungarians were inclined, like
    the Poles, to look to Napoleon as the possible restorer of their
    national independence. The policy of the Emperor Francis had been
    to treat the Hungarians, whom he had placed under the rule of his
    brother, the Archduke Joseph, as semi-independent, and to make as
    little change as possible in the Hungarian Constitution. He regarded
    his German provinces as the really important portion of his dominions,
    and gave them his undivided attention. After the Treaty of Pressburg,
    the Emperor dismissed his chancellor and prime minister Cobenzl,
    and replaced him by Count Philip Stadion. The new Chancellor was a
    thorough German, though descended from a Grisons family, and the
    main point of his policy was to rouse the patriotism of the Germans
    as a nationality against the French. In fact, from 1805 until the
    outbreak of war in 1809, Stadion endeavoured to arouse the national
    spirit which afterwards made Germany successful in the final war of
    liberation against Napoleon. He circulated patriotic literature, and
    formulated the idea of German unity, which he saw must take the place
    of the extinct notion of the Holy Roman Empire.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span> He was successful
    in rousing the German popular feeling to the greatest height in the
    German provinces of Austria; but the time was not yet ripe for the
    expression of a similar sentiment throughout the whole of Germany. The
    weight of the Continental Blockade was not experienced in its fullest
    form until after 1809. And the patriotic feeling which was to have so
    full a development could not be stirred up in a moment. But in the
    German territories of Austria Stadion was completely successful. The
    Emperor Francis himself was a thorough German, and during the progress
    which he made through his states in 1808, with his beautiful second
    wife, the Empress Ludovica, a princess of Modena, roused the utmost
    enthusiasm. Ever since the Peace of Pressburg the Archduke Charles,
    as Commander-in-Chief, had been organising the military power of
    Austria; regiments of volunteers were formed in Vienna and all the
    large cities; and the militia for the first time were disciplined
    and trained for offensive war, and not maintained merely for the
    preservation of the peace. While the smaller princes of Germany were
    obsequiously doing honour to Napoleon at Erfurt, the Emperor of Austria
    was preparing for war. The successful insurrection of the Spaniards,
    and the Capitulation of Baylen, encouraged Stadion in his belief that
    if a national feeling could be roused against the French domination,
    it would be as successful in Germany as in Spain. The English Ministry
    encouraged the attitude of the Austrian Emperor, and promised not only
    large subsidies if an Austrian army would take the field, but also
    that a powerful diversion should be made in the Netherlands by an
    English army. Napoleon heard of this disposition of Austria in 1808,
    but at first paid very little heed to it. During his winter campaign
    in the Peninsula, however, it became obvious that the Austrians were
    in a hurry to come to conclusions with him, and he therefore hastened
    back from Spain to make his preparations for this new war, instead of
    pursuing the English to Corunna.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Campaign of Wagram. 1809.</div>

  <p>From both the political and the military point of view,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span> Napoleon was
    justified in believing in 1809 that he had little to fear from the
    intervention of Austria. The South German princes, like the Kings of
    Bavaria and Würtemberg, had been too much favoured by him to desire to
    oppose him, and willingly sent their contingents to serve in his ranks.
    From the population of his new creation, the kingdom of Westphalia, he
    looked for assistance, not opposition, and what remained of Prussia was
    occupied by French armies. The Emperor Alexander of Russia, still under
    the glamour of the interview at Erfurt, and the grand promises for the
    division of the world repeated to him there, showed no inclination to
    assist Austria. Indeed, the feeling of opposition between Austria and
    Russia, which had shown itself in 1799 and 1800, had been augmented
    by the unfortunate campaign of Austerlitz. Each ally blamed the other
    for that disaster; the Austrian officers openly declared that they
    hated a Russian more than a Frenchman, and the Russians reciprocated
    this feeling. Austria’s only ally, therefore, was England. From a
    military point of view, the Austrian army had not yet been sufficiently
    reorganised, in spite of the efforts of Stadion and the Archduke
    Charles, to make a successful resistance to the French; but, as the
    event of the campaign showed, it was able to make a better stand than
    it had ever made before.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Battle of Aspern. 21st and 22nd May 1809.</div>

  <p>In April 1809 the Archduke Charles, amid the greatest enthusiasm of
    the Austrian people, issued a manifesto to the German race, and at the
    head of 170,000 men advanced into Bavaria. At the same time another
    army, under the Archduke John, invaded Italy. At that moment Napoleon
    had only two <i>corps d’armée</i> in Southern Germany, one under the command
    of Marshal Davout at Ratisbon, and the other under Marshal Masséna
    at Augsburg. The Archduke Charles intended to get between the two
    marshals and defeat them separately. But Napoleon arrived in person,
    with some of the finest troops he had been employing in Spain, before
    the Archduke could complete his operations. On the 20th of April he
    defeated the Austrian left at Abensberg, and on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span> 22d he routed
    the Austrian right under the Archduke in person at Eckmühl. In the
    five days’ fighting, which included these battles, the Austrians lost
    7000 men in killed and wounded, and 23,000 prisoners. In the result it
    was the Austrians, not the French, who were cut in two, and Napoleon
    rapidly followed the Austrian left to Vienna. The capital surrendered
    on the 12th of May, and Napoleon then resolved to cross the Danube and
    attack the main body of the Austrian army under the Archduke Charles.
    He attempted to pass the river at the point where is situated midway
    the island of Lobau. When the greater part of his army had reached the
    island he pushed across to the other bank, and on the 21st and 22nd of
    May stormed the villages of Aspern and Essling. But on the evening of
    the second fight he found it necessary to withdraw into the island of
    Lobau, for his bridges of boats which connected the island with the
    right bank of the river had been swept away, and his ammunition had
    fallen short. The Tyrolese, too, had risen under Hofer, and Napoleon’s
    position was most critical. Nevertheless he determined not to retreat;
    the island of Lobau became an entrenched camp; stronger bridges were
    thrown from it to the right bank of the Danube; and reinforcements were
    summoned from different quarters.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Battle of Wagram. 6th July 1809.</div>

  <p>The most important of these reinforcements were supplied by the French
    Army of Italy, which reached Napoleon in the island of Lobau on the
    2nd of July. This army was commanded by the Viceroy of Italy, Eugène
    de Beauharnais, whose military adviser and principal subordinate was
    General Macdonald. The Viceroy had, before Macdonald reached him, been
    checked at Sacilio by the Archduke John, but after Macdonald’s arrival
    he pushed on rapidly. A decisive victory, which prevented the Archduke
    John from pursuing, was won over the Hungarians at Raab on the 14th of
    June, after which Eugène de Beauharnais was enabled safely to join the
    Emperor in the island of Lobau. With his army<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span> thus increased, Napoleon
    crossed to the left bank of the Danube on the morning of the 5th of
    July, at the head of 180,000 men, many of whom were Westphalians,
    Bavarians, and Italians. On the following day he completely defeated
    the Archduke Charles at the battle of Wagram, at which the Austrians
    lost more than 30,000 men. Though defeated, the Austrian army was not
    disgraced, and Napoleon himself said, when blamed for not following
    up his victory, ‘If I had had my veterans of Austerlitz I should have
    carried out a manœuvre which, with my present troops, I dare not
    execute.’ Had the Archduke John come up in time and placed himself
    under his brother’s command, the battle might have had a different
    result, and as it was, the Austrian Emperor need not have considered
    himself forced to conclude peace.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Treaty of Vienna. 14th October 1809.</div>

  <p>The Emperor Francis, however, did not dare to risk the further event
    of war, and on the 14th of October 1809 he signed the Treaty of
    Vienna. By this treaty Austria ceded Trieste, Carniola, Istria, and
    a large part of Croatia to Napoleon, who added them to Dalmatia,
    which he had acquired at the Treaty of Pressburg, and made out of
    them the Government of the Illyrian Provinces. Francis also abandoned
    the Tyrolese, and ceded the greater part of Salzburg to the King of
    Bavaria, whose army, along with the Saxon contingent under Bernadotte,
    had played a great part in winning the victory of Wagram. He had to
    give up the whole of Western Galicia; the greater part of this province
    was added to the Grand Duchy of Warsaw, but certain districts were
    ceded to the Emperor Alexander, who in reply to the demands of Napoleon
    had despatched an army to act in that quarter against the Austrians.
    This action had still further incensed the Emperor of Austria against
    the Emperor of Russia, while it did not satisfy Napoleon, who
    complained that the Russians had not acted with sufficient vigour,
    and had been waiting to hear the result of the main campaign in
    the neighbourhood of Vienna. In Austria itself the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span> important
    result of the war was the retirement of Count Philip Stadion, who was
    succeeded as Chancellor of State by Count Metternich.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Peninsular War. 1809.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Battle of Talavera. 28th July 1809.</div>

  <p>During the campaign of Wagram the French armies left in Spain had been
    continuing their operations. Before the actual outbreak of war with
    Austria, Saragossa had been captured on the 21st of February 1809,
    after an obstinate siege, which proved to the French the mettle of
    their new opponents. The most important operations had been carried
    out in three quarters of the Peninsula. In Arragon and Catalonia,
    General Gouvion-Saint-Cyr acted with considerable skill in a campaign
    of which the main feature was the reduction of small fortresses, and
    his successor, General Suchet, steadily pursued the same policy. Both
    of these generals invariably defeated any Spanish army which met them
    in the field. From Madrid King Joseph had acted in two different
    directions. Marshal Moncey took Valencia; Marshal Victor defeated the
    Spanish army of the South, which was under the command of Cuesta, at
    Medellin; and General Sebastiani approached the frontiers of Andalusia.
    But in Portugal the French had again to meet the English, who had in
    the previous year defeated them at Vimeiro, and drawn them away to
    Corunna. After the departure of Sir John Moore’s army, Marshal Soult
    had invaded Portugal from the north and occupied Oporto. There is no
    doubt that if he had acted boldly he might have captured Lisbon, which
    was only guarded by a feeble division under Sir John Cradock. But Soult
    wasted his time in intriguing, it is said, for the throne of Portugal,
    until the English Ministry had time to reinforce Cradock, and to
    send Sir Arthur Wellesley to command the army in Portugal. Wellesley
    speedily dislodged Soult from Oporto, and drove his army in disorder
    back into Galicia. He then, following the example of Moore, invaded
    Spain, in the expectation of saving Andalusia. He met the French
    army in Spain, under the command of Marshal Victor, at Talavera. He
    repulsed the French<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span> attack on his position on the 28th of July, and
    had he been efficiently assisted by the Spaniards under Cuesta he might
    have won a great victory. As it was, his success prevented the French
    from invading Portugal, but it was not sufficiently decisive to save
    Andalusia. The French army was reorganised; the Spaniards were routed
    at the battle of Ocana, on the 12th of November, and the whole of the
    fertile province of Andalusia, with the exception of Gibraltar and
    Cadiz, fell into the hands of the French.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Expedition to Walcheren. 1809.</div>

  <p>Unfortunately the English Ministers failed to understand immediately
    the greatness of the opportunity given to them by Napoleon’s behaviour
    in the Peninsula, and instead of concentrating all their military
    strength for the support of Sir Arthur Wellesley, who was made Viscount
    Wellington for his victory of Talavera, they despatched one of the
    finest armies that ever left England on the Walcheren Expedition. They
    had promised to assist the Emperor of Austria by making a diversion in
    the north of Europe. The object of this diversion was Antwerp, on which
    city Napoleon was spending vast sums of money in the hope of making it
    the commercial rival of London. This expedition, which was placed under
    the command of the Earl of Chatham, the elder brother of the younger
    Pitt, never reached Antwerp. It was landed in the island of Walcheren,
    and took Flushing in August 1809. It met no French army worthy of
    the name, but was destroyed as a fighting machine by the pestilences
    and fevers of the unhealthy island in which it was quartered. The
    expedition took place too late to be of any service to Austria, for the
    English army did not disembark until a month after the battle of Wagram
    had been fought, and in the want of energy with which it was conducted,
    it may almost be classed with the disastrous expedition to Bergen in
    1799. At sea, however, the English fleet maintained its pre-eminence.
    In this year Guadeloupe, Martinique, and the Mauritius were conquered,
    and an attempt was made to burn the French fleet in the Basque Roads by
    Lord Cochrane, which might have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span> been completely successful if he had
    not been thwarted by the admiral in command, Lord Gambier.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Napoleon and the Pope.</div>

  <p>It has been said that one of the measures by which Napoleon secured
    his ascendency over the minds of the French people was the conclusion
    of the Concordat by which the schism which had divided the French
    Church was closed. He had at the commencement of his tenure of power
    treated the new Pope, Pius <span class="smcap">VII.</span>, with much respect, and the
    Pope had in return made the Emperor’s uncle, Fesch, a Cardinal, and had
    come to Paris to crown him Emperor. But troubles soon arose between
    Napoleon and Pius <span class="smcap">VII.</span> The Emperor proclaimed himself the
    successor of Charlemagne, and wished to restrict the Pope entirely
    to spiritual affairs. The terms of the Concordat were not thoroughly
    carried out. The Pope would not give Napoleon the supreme authority
    over the French bishops, which he desired, and His Holiness looked on
    the transformation of the priesthood in France from an independent
    body into salaried officials with extreme disfavour. On the Pope’s
    return to Rome in 1805, he requested that the French troops should
    evacuate the whole of the former States of the Church. Napoleon did not
    comply with this request, and not satisfied with ordaining the cession
    of the Legations of Bologna and Ferrara to the Kingdom of Italy, he
    occupied Ancona, and confiscated the principalities of Ponte Corvo
    and Benevento, which he bestowed on Bernadotte and Talleyrand. The
    declaration of the Continental Blockade increased the dissatisfaction
    of the Pope, who declined to obey it, as he also did a further order in
    1806 to expel from Rome all English, Russian, Swedish, and Sardinian
    subjects. After some months of perpetual bickering Napoleon directed
    General Miollis to occupy Rome on the 2nd of February 1808. Pius
    <span class="smcap">VII.</span>, in the cause of peace, dismissed Cardinal Consalvi,
    his Secretary of State, but he could not satisfy the demands of the
    Emperor, and on the 17th of May 1809 the States of the Church in Italy
    were declared united to the French Empire, and Rome was officially
    decreed to be the Second City of that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span> Empire. Exasperated by this open
    insult, Pius <span class="smcap">VII.</span> excommunicated the French Emperor. Napoleon,
    who was at that time in his camp in the island of Lobau, ordered that
    the Pope should be removed from Rome. He was arrested by General Radet
    on the 6th of July, the day of the victory of Wagram, and forcibly
    removed to Savona, near Genoa, where he was kept as a State prisoner.
    Pius <span class="smcap">VII.</span> in his exile consistently protested against the
    usurpations of Napoleon, and refused from this time to give canonical
    institution to the bishops nominated by the Emperor. In 1811 Napoleon
    attempted to put ecclesiastical affairs in France on a new footing, and
    summoned a national council or synod of bishops to meet at Paris. But
    the Pope refused to negotiate with the synod, and he was accordingly
    removed to Fontainebleau in 1812. While there Napoleon pretended
    that His Holiness agreed to a new and revised Concordat which was
    promulgated as a law on the 13th of February 1813. Pius <span class="smcap">VII.</span>
    always denied that he had given his consent to the new arrangement,
    which would have deprived him of his most valued prerogatives, and
    stated that he had always regarded himself as a prisoner since his
    removal from Rome. By his conduct towards the Pope Napoleon committed
    a great mistake. He lost the support of the faithful body of Catholics
    in France whom he had conciliated in 1801, and he gave a pretext for
    his enemies to declare him the enemy of religion. The Caesarism which
    had infected his imagination after his great victories in 1806 and 1807
    appeared in his behaviour towards Pius <span class="smcap">VII.</span> as well as in his
    intervention with the affairs of Spain.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Revolution in Sweden. 1809.</div>

  <p>The year 1809, which witnessed the campaign of Wagram and the overthrow
    of the Pope, was also signalised by a revolution in Sweden, which was
    followed by very important results. It has been said that Gustavus
    <span class="smcap">IV.</span> remained faithful to the coalition against Napoleon even
    after the Peace of Tilsit. By that peace it was arranged that the
    Emperor of Russia should annex Finland. This was carried out in 1808,
    after a very weak opposition on the part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span> of the Swedes, and in the
    same year Swedish Pomerania was occupied by the French. In spite of
    these losses the King of Sweden declared war against Denmark, and
    then quarrelled with the general of the English army sent to his
    assistance. For this conduct, which seemed conclusive as to the loss
    of sanity by the King, the Swedes resolved to dethrone him. At the
    commencement of 1809 the Baron Adlersparre, the commander-in-chief of
    the army sent to invade Norway, concluded a secret armistice with the
    Danes, and marched on Stockholm. On the 13th of March 1809 the King was
    arrested, and on the 29th he was forced to sign a deed of abdication.
    This act was ratified by the States of Sweden on the 10th of May, and
    the King’s uncle, the Duke of Sudermania, was elected King as Charles
    <span class="smcap">XIII.</span> A new constitution of an aristocratic type, restoring
    the power of the Swedish nobles which had been severely curtailed by
    Gustavus <span class="smcap">III.</span>, was promulgated, and on the 18th of January
    1810 the States elected as heir to the throne, since the new King had
    no sons, the Prince Christian of Holstein-Augustenberg. This young
    prince died in May of the same year, and the question then arose as to
    his successor. There was no possible prince of the reigning family,
    and the king was old and in bad health. It happened that in 1806 the
    Swedish officers employed in Hanover had made the acquaintance of
    Marshal Bernadotte, who commanded in that quarter, and it was suggested
    that he should be elected as Prince Royal. This choice was dictated by
    a hope that it would please the French Emperor, for Bernadotte was not
    only one of his most distinguished marshals, but was connected with
    his family, for both he and Joseph Bonaparte had married daughters
    of Monsieur Clary, a tradesman of Marseilles. Bernadotte received
    the consent of Napoleon; on the 19th of October 1810 he abjured
    Catholicism; and on the 5th of November he was elected Prince Royal by
    the Swedish Diet. He was at once charged with the direction of foreign
    affairs and with the reorganisation of the Swedish army, and he played
    an important part in the overthrow of the French Emperor.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Treaty of Bucharest. 28th May 1812.</div>

  <p>With Sweden and Poland, Turkey had for a long time been considered
    as the third barrier against the advance of Russia. Bonaparte, like
    earlier French statesmen, had held this view, but after the Peace
    of Tilsit he expressed himself as ready and willing to abandon all
    three countries to the encroachments of Russia. The loss of Finland
    and Pomerania had reduced Sweden to a minor state; the Grand Duchy of
    Warsaw was a poor substitute for the Kingdom of Poland, and it is now
    necessary to observe the effects upon Turkey of her abandonment by
    France. The Sultan, Selim <span class="smcap">III.</span>, had been thrown into a close
    alliance with England by Napoleon’s occupation of Egypt when he was
    but a general of the French Republic, and still more by his daring
    march into Syria. When he became First Consul, Napoleon endeavoured to
    destroy the unfavourable opinion entertained of him at Constantinople,
    and sent thither as his ambassador one of the ablest of the French
    diplomatists, General Sebastiani, who managed to ingratiate himself
    with the Porte. The English monopoly of the commerce of the Levant
    was displeasing to the Porte, and Pitt failed to induce the Sultan to
    enter into the coalition against France in 1805. In 1807 an English
    fleet under Sir John Duckworth was sent to compel the Sultan to give
    up his friendship with the French. After forcing the passage of the
    Dardanelles, it had to retire without achieving its object, and
    suffered great loss while sailing down the Straits. This behaviour of
    England threw the Turks entirely on the side of France. French officers
    were employed to reorganise the Turkish army, and a regular militia was
    established. Sultan Selim was a monarch in advance of his times, and
    endeavoured to introduce certain reforms, but he roused against him
    both the Muhammadan Ulemas and the Janissaries. The former disliked his
    civil reforms, the latter his establishment of the militia. Selim was
    dethroned, and replaced by Mustapha <span class="smcap">IV.</span> on the 21st of July
    1807. But the reign of Mustapha was but of short duration. The Pasha
    of Rustchuk marched to Constantinople, and when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span> he found that the
    Sultan Selim had been assassinated, he dethroned Mustapha and placed
    his nephew, Mahmoud <span class="smcap">II.</span>, on the throne of Turkey. The first
    event of the new reign was a violent battle between the Janissaries and
    the freshly organised militia in the streets of Constantinople, after
    which Mahmoud executed his own brother and most of his relations, and
    established himself firmly on the throne. The new Sultan, who was a
    man of extraordinary vigour, was at once attacked by the Russians, as
    had been arranged by the Treaty of Tilsit. Napoleon had pointed out
    to Alexander that he could easily annex the Danubian principalities,
    and he hoped that the Turks would afford enough occupation to the
    Russian army to prevent it from interfering with his projects in
    Europe. The Russian attack on Turkey was followed by a treaty of peace
    between England and the Porte, in spite of the efforts of the French
    diplomatists; but the English, as usual, considered it enough to
    send subsidies in money without supplying troops. In 1809 the Turks
    were defeated at Braila and Silistria, and by the close of 1810 the
    Russian army under the command of Prince Bagration occupied the whole
    of Wallachia, Moldavia, and Bessarabia. In 1811 the Russian general
    Kutuzov crossed the Danube, and occupied both Silistria and Shumla,
    and the way was opened to Constantinople. But, fortunately for the
    existence of the Turkish power, Napoleon in 1812 was preparing to
    invade Russia; the efforts of the French diplomatists to induce the
    Sultan Mahmoud to continue the war were fruitless; the Porte said that
    it had too often proved the worthlessness of the French offers of
    help, and on the 28th of May 1812 a treaty of peace was signed between
    Russia and Turkey at Bucharest. By this treaty the Turks ceded part of
    Bessarabia and Moldavia to Russia, and acknowledged the Principality
    of Servia, but its chief importance in European history is that it
    relieved the Emperor Alexander from an important enemy at a moment of
    crisis, and allowed him to turn all his strength against the French
    invaders.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Greatest Extension of Napoleon’s Empire. 1809–1812.</div>

  <p>The period from 1809 to 1812, that is, from the Peace of Vienna to
    the invasion of Russia, witnessed the greatest extension of the
    dominions of Napoleon. But this enormous increase of territory did not
    strengthen France; new difficulties appeared with each fresh advance;
    and although in 1811 the boundaries of the French power were far more
    distended than they were in 1808, the Empire was not so strong. By his
    annexations Napoleon abandoned the principle which he had formerly
    set before himself. He had declared that the natural boundaries of
    France were the Rhine and the Alps, and every annexation beyond those
    natural limits was a distinct act of defiance to Europe. From 1806
    to 1808 his policy was to surround France with a belt of subject
    kingdoms; by his annexations from 1809 to 1812 his borders touched
    those of the great Continental powers. In the north Napoleon accepted
    the abdication of his brother Louis, who had protested against the
    measures taken for maintaining the Continental Blockade, and on the
    9th of July 1810 he declared Holland an integral part of the Empire.
    Holland was divided into eight departments, and lost its existence as
    an independent nation. Then in pursuance of the Continental Blockade,
    Napoleon, on the 13th of December 1810, annexed the districts in North
    Germany from the borders of Holland to the mouth of the Weser. By
    this step he united the whole coast-line from Friesland to Denmark,
    and hoped to close entirely the English trade with North Germany.
    The districts annexed were the Duchy of Oldenburg, the sea-coast of
    Hanover, the territories of the Princes of Salm and Aremberg, and
    the free cities of Bremen, Hamburg, and Lübeck. These districts were
    divided into four departments, the Ems-Supérieur, the Lippe, the
    Bouches-du-Weser, and the Bouches-de-l’Elbe, with their capitals at
    Osnabrück, Münster, Bremen, and Hamburg. These annexations showed
    what persistent opposition Napoleon met in Germany to the Continental
    Blockade, when his own brother Louis could not maintain it in Holland,
    and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span> was afraid to trust the coast-line of Westphalia to his
    brother Jerome. Turning further south, Napoleon in 1810 annexed the
    Valais, which he had declared independent of Switzerland, under the
    name of the Department of the Simplon. In Italy the most flagrant
    breach of the former French system was committed. When the kingdom
    of Italy was formed in 1805, the Emperor had kept Piedmont under his
    own control in order to command both sides of the Alps, and in 1810
    he preferred to amalgamate the Ligurian Republic, Parma, the Kingdom
    of Etruria, and the States of the Church with his directly-governed
    departments in Piedmont, rather than to unite them to the Kingdom of
    Italy. These districts were divided into nine departments, and it is
    curious to notice such cities as Rome, Genoa, Parma, Florence, Siena,
    and Leghorn as capitals of French departments. In all, the French
    Empire at its greatest consisted of one hundred and thirty departments
    directly administered from Paris, excluding from consideration the
    Illyrian provinces and the Ionian Islands, which were not treated as
    departments. Mention has already been made of the subject kingdoms,
    and it is only to be noted here that Murat, the famous cavalry general
    and brother-in-law of Napoleon, was made King of Naples when Joseph
    Bonaparte was promoted to the throne of Spain, and that the infant
    son of Louis Bonaparte, the former King of Holland, received Murat’s
    Grand Duchy of Berg. Napoleon also made his favourite sister, Elisa,
    Grand Duchess of Tuscany and Princess of Lucca and Piombino; his second
    sister, Pauline, Duchess of Guastalla; and his Chief of the Staff and
    most trusted subordinate, Marshal Berthier, independent Prince of
    Neufchâtel.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Internal Organisation of the Empire.</div>

  <p>The administration of this vast empire was purely bureaucratic.
    Napoleon endeavoured to establish a hierarchy of civil officials, who
    should be as completely under his direct control as the officers of
    his army. He ruled the Empire like a general. Implicit obedience to
    orders was the only means to promotion in his civil, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span> well as in his
    military, organisation. He delighted in insisting on this comparison.
    The Legion of Honour was not a military order, but was conferred with
    equal freedom on civil officials, and in all matters the Emperor’s
    will could be consulted and was supreme. No subjects were too minute
    for his supervision. He reorganised the ancient theatrical company of
    the Comédie Française with the same attention to detail as a matter
    of State administration. The development of a bureaucracy dependent
    on absolutism was in curious contrast to the Constitution of 1791,
    and the theories which had prevailed at the beginning of the French
    Revolution. Freedom of petition, freedom of the press, individual
    liberty, representative institutions, and all the liberties won by the
    French people were entirely abolished. The censorship of the press was
    re-established, and carried out with more rigour than it had been even
    under the Bourbon monarchy. All manuscripts had to be revised before
    being sent to the printer, and perfectly innocent allusions, which
    might be interpreted into applying condemnation of the existing order
    of things, brought upon their authors immediate imprisonment, and the
    destruction of their books. Individual liberty ceased to exist; for the
    Emperor exiled and imprisoned at his will. The secret police, which
    had been organised by Fouché, exercised a minute inquisition into the
    most private affairs, and a crowd of spies kept the Emperor informed
    of every current of opinion in Paris and throughout the Empire. The
    arbitrariness of his government was greatly due to his sensitiveness to
    public opinion, and it is narrated that during his enforced residence
    in the island of Lobau he was far more exercised in mind by his spies’
    reports of the conversations on the subject in the Faubourg St. Germain
    than by the movements of the Austrians. Representative institutions
    had been practically superseded by the Constitution of the Year
    <span class="smcap">VIII.</span>, but the last vestige of a power which could criticise
    the Emperor’s will, the Tribunate, was suppressed in 1808. The Senate
    became merely a dignified body to congratulate the Emperor on his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
    victories, and the Legislative Body registered, without murmuring, all
    his decrees. It is a curious fact that, in 1811, Napoleon imitated the
    most arbitrary measure of the Committee of Public Safety, and, when the
    price of corn rose, he fixed a maximum price for its sale in Paris.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Hereditary Principle.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Napoleon’s Aristocracy.</div>

  <p>Next to his own absolutism Napoleon believed in the principle of
    heredity. He showed this primarily in the treatment of his own family.
    He not only brought his mother to Paris, and under the title of Madame
    Mère endowed her with a large income, but bestowed on his brothers
    and sisters, in spite of the marked incapacity of many of them, the
    most important posts. The kingdoms given to Joseph, Louis, and Jerome
    Bonaparte were accompanied by the intimation that they were to rule
    subject to his will, and he exercised an autocratic power over all the
    members of his family. For instance, he insisted that Jerome should
    divorce his wife, an American lady named Patterson, because his own
    consent had not been obtained, and forced him to marry a Würtemberg
    princess. His own lack of children greatly grieved him, and he made
    various arrangements as to his successor. At one time it was thought
    he would nominate his step-son, Eugène de Beauharnais; at another he
    selected an infant son of his brother Louis to be his heir, and had him
    baptized by the Pope just after his own coronation in 1805; and when
    the infant died, he issued a decree, arranging the succession among
    his brothers and their children in order of seniority. He created his
    brothers, sisters, and step-children Princes of the Empire, and gave
    them honorary seats in the Senate and Council of State, and he insisted
    upon his wife Josephine surrounding herself with all the pomp of a
    monarchical Court. The desire of creating a Court which should outshine
    that of the Bourbons caused Napoleon to bid high for the support of
    the ancient noble families of France. By bestowing large incomes,
    rapid promotion, and repeated favours he was able to get men and women
    bearing the oldest names in France to accept office as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span> chamberlains
    and lords and ladies-in-waiting, while many scions of former sovereign
    families in Germany and the Netherlands did not hesitate to request
    admission to such Court offices. But he did not trust solely to the old
    nobility to form the splendour of his Court; he always suspected that
    they were sneering at him, and endeavoured to counterbalance them by
    creating a new nobility. This new nobility was formed entirely from the
    men who did him good service, whether in military or civil departments.
    By the side of his marshals, most of whom he created dukes, he ranked
    his chief diplomatists and ministers, and the example was followed into
    inferior ranks. Good service as the <i>préfet</i> of a department led to a
    barony as certainly as gallant service in the field at the head of a
    regiment, and former members of the Convention, who, as Deputies on
    Mission, had exerted unlimited authority, were content to accept the
    title of Chevalier of the Empire, the lowest in his new peerage. The
    peerage of the Empire was strictly hereditary, though in many instances
    the Emperor assumed the right exercised by former kings of granting
    permission to adopt an heir. But the new peerage was purely ornamental;
    it conferred no political power whatever. Napoleon never dreamt of
    creating a House of Lords; he only conceived the notion of balancing
    the influence of the old aristocracy by the creation of one dependent
    entirely on himself. In his desire to maintain the dignity of his new
    nobles, he granted many of them large incomes and vast estates; his
    marshals were encouraged to live in the most extravagant fashion by
    the repeated payment of their debts; and the grant of a peerage was in
    many cases accompanied by what he called a <i>dotation</i>, which supplied
    an income sufficient to maintain the dignity. Some of these ‘dotations’
    were of princely magnificence. They were largely situated in Italy
    and Poland, and were intended to make the new possessors independent
    barons, like the famous paladins of Charlemagne. Among the most
    important of these grants, after the Principality of Neufchâtel, which
    was a semi-independent <span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>sovereignty, may be noted the Principalities
    of Benevento, Ponte Corvo, Parma, Piacenza, and Gaeta, which were
    conferred upon Talleyrand, Bernadotte, Cambacérès, Le Brun, and Gaudin.
    By these means Napoleon hoped to keep his subordinates faithful to him,
    while their influence on opinion would rival that exercised by the old
    nobility.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Internal Reforms. Law.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Finance.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Education.</div>

  <p>But while wielding an undisputed absolutism, Napoleon looked on his
    position in a spirit similar to that of the benevolent despots of the
    eighteenth century. Though he would do nothing by the people, he was
    ready to do much for them. In the path of legal reform he followed up
    the measure taken by the formation of the Civil Code. He had plenty of
    learned jurists to carry out his instructions, and the Civil Code was
    succeeded, in 1806, by the Codes of Civil and Criminal Procedure, in
    1808 by the Commercial Code, and finally by the Penal Code. These great
    codes form an epoch in the legal history of Europe, and have earned
    for Napoleon the title of the modern Justinian, though they were only
    carried out by his directions, and based on the principles laid down,
    and the work done, by the Constituent Assembly and the Convention.
    Their great advantage was their simplicity and universality, which
    checked the tedious delays inherent in all systems of common or
    uncodified law. In jurisdiction Napoleon also followed the example of
    the statesmen of the Revolution. He encouraged rapidity in procedure
    and in the execution of judgments, and he greatly extended the powers
    of the commercial tribunals in which practical men of business had
    a voice. In financial matters, as in his legal reforms, Napoleon’s
    great aim was to attain simplicity, and he reduced the loss in the
    passage of taxes from the taxpayer to the Treasury to a minimum. His
    creation of the Bank of France has been mentioned, and by its side
    he established the Caisse d’Amortissement, which consisted of the
    pecuniary guarantees of all the collectors of the taxes merged into one
    fund. These guarantees formed an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span> important sum of money for immediate
    use as well as a valuable security. Napoleon further managed to pay off
    that portion of the debt left to him by the Republic, which represented
    the sums due for the suppression of the old courts of judicature,
    etc. With regard to the ordinary debt, he preserved Cambon’s great
    creation of the Grand Livre, which enabled every creditor to become
    a fund-holder, while the Emperor knew the exact extent of the public
    debt. The Emperor’s first steps towards the formation of a national
    system of education have been described, but it was not until after
    the campaign of Wagram that the system was completed. In 1806 he had
    organised the Imperial University, but it did not take its final form
    until 1811. This university was not a university in the English sense.
    It consisted of the chief professors and teachers, and was intended
    to include all the professors and teachers throughout France. It was
    placed under the superintendence of a Grand Master, a celebrated man
    of letters, Fontanes, and its duty was to superintend the whole course
    of higher education. In the Emperor’s own words, he wished to create
    a teaching profession organised like the judicial or the military
    profession, of which all the professors scattered throughout the
    country might feel themselves an integral part. In 1808 he granted the
    university an income of 400,000 livres, in addition to the fees, etc.,
    and declared in favour of the irremovability of its members. To recruit
    this new teaching profession, Napoleon established the Normal School of
    Paris for the instruction of those who desired to become professors or
    teachers.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Extension of the system to Germany.</div>

  <p>These great reforms in law, in finance, and in education outlasted
    Napoleon’s reconstitution of Europe. Their effect spread far beyond the
    actual limits of France. As a direct result of the French Revolution
    serfdom disappeared in Switzerland, in Belgium, and in Northern Italy.
    Napoleon carried on the work further to the east. In the Kingdom of
    Westphalia, and in all the states of Germany which he created or
    enlarged, serfdom was entirely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span> abolished. The feudal system was
    suppressed wherever the influence of the French extended. Maximilian
    Joseph, King of Bavaria, and his minister, Montgelas, carried out the
    principles of the French Revolution by abolishing the privileges of
    the nobility and the clergy. In every direction the French codes were
    either adopted or imitated; the course of justice was made simple and
    cheap; education was organised; and the economical rules of the French
    administration introduced. In more distant countries the same reforms
    were carried out. By the constitution of the Grand Duchy of Warsaw
    the Polish serfs, perhaps the most miserable of all serfs, were freed
    from their bondage, and absolute equality before the law decreed. In
    Naples Joseph Bonaparte and Murat, and in Spain Joseph Bonaparte by
    himself, carried out the same great reforms; and though the reaction
    after 1815 tended to replace matters on their former footing, it proved
    to be impossible to restore the old evils in their entirety. Not
    less admirable was Napoleon’s vindication of the great principle of
    religious toleration. In Catholic states such as Bavaria Protestants
    received the priceless boon of religious liberty; in Protestant states
    like Saxony it was the Catholics who profited by the broad-mindedness
    of the French Emperor; and in every country the Jews were relieved
    from the degrading position in which they had been kept. In military
    organisation the reforms which had made the French army master of the
    world were introduced by Napoleon. With the disappearance of the petty
    German states disappeared also the feudal armies. Conscription may,
    indeed, appear a heavy burden on a state, but in Germany, at any rate,
    it created for the first time national armies to take the place of the
    ill-disciplined mercenaries who had hitherto been hired by the petty
    princes.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Organisation of Prussia.</div>

  <p>The most curious feature in the creation of a new Germany, which was
    the result of Napoleon’s reforms as much as of his victories, was
    the formation of new Prussia. In Germany proper, that is, in Germany
    between the Rhine and the Elbe, reforms were introduced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span> under French
    supervision, if not always by French agents. In Prussia the reforms
    came on the initiative of a great minister. The speedy overthrow of
    the famed Prussian army in the campaign of Jena convinced Prussian
    statesmen of the necessity for sweeping changes. By the Treaty of
    Tilsit Prussia was shorn of all the acquisitions in Central Germany
    which she had received as the price of her consistent neutrality, and
    was thrust behind the Elbe. On the other side she lost her Polish
    provinces. Even the small Prussia thus left was occupied by French
    troops, and was forced to pay a war contribution of a hundred and forty
    millions as well as to maintain an army of 42,000 men for the service
    of Napoleon. It would seem that Prussia was to be driven back into the
    position of a second-rate state, but at this juncture Frederick William
    <span class="smcap">III.</span> summoned to his ministry two remarkable men—the Freiherr
    vom Stein, a Knight of the Holy Roman Empire and a native of Nassau,
    and Scharnhorst, a Hanoverian officer. Neither of these men were
    Prussians, but they were both enthusiastic Germans. They believed that
    Prussia would yet form the key-stone on which German emancipation from
    the power of Napoleon could be reared. They understood that Prussia
    must be entirely reconstituted, and that an old-fashioned Prussia could
    neither combat Napoleon nor lead the new Germany which he had created.
    Stein, therefore, as Minister of the Interior, adapted the reforms
    of the French Revolution and of Napoleon to Prussia. He established
    equality before the law by the abolition of serfdom, he suppressed the
    territorial privileges of the nobility, and he gave permission to the
    bourgeois and the peasants to purchase land. He encouraged municipal
    life by introducing a system of election to municipal offices, and,
    as far as he could, abolished the social privileges of the nobility.
    Scharnhorst, as War Minister, reorganised the Prussian army on the
    French model. He changed it from an entity independent of the people
    into a national army. Since Prussia was only permitted to maintain an
    army of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span> 42,000 men, he arranged that as many as possible should obtain
    a military training by passing through the ranks for a short period. He
    went further than Napoleon. He did not adopt a system of conscription
    by which a portion of the population designed by lot should enter
    the ranks, but insisted that every citizen was bound to military
    service. Between 1807 and 1810, and the system was continued after his
    retirement until 1813, Scharnhorst passed a large proportion of the
    youth of Prussia through the ranks of the army, and thus formed—what
    Napoleon so greatly needed at the crisis of his career—an effective
    reserve. It is interesting to observe that it was in the country most
    maltreated by Napoleon that the French reforms were most successfully
    initiated. Napoleon perceived the danger, and in 1808 he insisted on
    the dismissal of Stein, and in 1810 on that of Scharnhorst.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The revival of German national feeling.</div>

  <p>It is a curious sequel to the benefits conferred upon Germany by
    Napoleon directly and by the influence of French principles that their
    result was to rouse in Germany, for the first time for many centuries,
    a truly national feeling. This was caused chiefly by the suppression of
    the Holy Roman Empire, and its being replaced by states large enough
    to arouse national patriotism; but it was partly due also to a sense
    of national degradation inspired by the presence of French armies, and
    to the fact that the benefits conferred were the gift of a foreign
    sovereign and not the result of national progress. A universal feeling
    of opposition to the French grew up in the hearts of the German people.
    The individualist doctrines, which found favour in the eighteenth
    century and reached their highest expression in philosophers and poets,
    such as Herder and Goethe, gave way to a new national sentiment,
    inspired by a new school of poets and political thinkers represented
    by Körner and Arndt, by Jahn and Friedrich von Gentz. The new spirit
    was mainly developed among the German youth. Secret societies and
    clubs were formed to obtain by force the freedom of Germany from the
    French, and the dissatisfied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span> souls forgot the benefits they had
    received individually in their resentment at their being granted by
    France. Austria under the administration of Count Philip Stadion, who
    was largely inspired by Gentz, endeavoured, in 1809, to take advantage
    of the revival of German national feeling. But Austria was universally
    considered as a foreign power whose military prowess was derived from
    Hungary, and the Emperor Francis in taking the new title of Emperor of
    Austria gave countenance to this idea. The House of Hapsburg was not
    regarded as thoroughly German; it was looked on as a foreign dynasty,
    whose dominions were mainly inhabited by non-German races; its loyalty
    to the Roman Catholic religion caused it to be suspected by the
    Protestants; it was blamed for the disorganisation of past centuries;
    and contemned for its repeated defeats by the French and its selfish
    policy at the time of the treaties of Campo-Formio and Lunéville.</p>

  <p>Prussia, on the other hand, though, like Austria, it was not a truly
    German state, seemed fitted by history and tradition to embody the
    idea of German nationality. Even after the defeat of Jena, Frederick
    the Great and his victory over the French at Rossbach were recalled as
    distinctively German glories, and the eyes of patriotic Germans were
    turned to the diminished power of Prussia as the natural lever for
    the creation of a free Germany. The administrative system of Prussia
    and its strongly concentrated political theory of the essential unity
    of the State, as opposed to the new French idea of the omnipotence
    of the people, which was condemned in German eyes as having led to
    the absolutism of an adventurer, had always exercised a peculiar
    fascination over the best intellects of Germany. It was by means of
    statesmen of foreign birth that Prussia was reorganised and prepared
    to cope successfully with the power of Napoleon. Stein and Hardenberg,
    Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, York and Lombard were none of them native
    Prussians; yet they were all in turn attracted into the Prussian
    service, and were instrumental in bringing about her resurrection as
    a German power. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span> war of 1809 first showed Napoleon that he was
    soon to have a national feeling to deal with in Germany as well as in
    Spain. While Napoleon was in the neighbourhood of Vienna a Prussian
    lieutenant of the name of Katt attempted to seize Magdeburg; a Prussian
    major named Schill pillaged the arsenal and treasury of the Duke of
    Anhalt, who had often expressed his outspoken admiration for the
    French Emperor, and invaded Saxony; and the fourth son of the Duke of
    Brunswick, the heir to the duchy which had been absorbed in the kingdom
    of Westphalia, raised his Black Legion, which he termed the Army of
    Vengeance, and carried on a partisan war. Even the person of Napoleon
    was not safe in Germany. A lad named Staps was shot for imagining an
    attack on his life at Schönbrunn in 1809, and many other conspiracies
    were discovered by the French police. Napoleon despised this ebullition
    of popular feeling in Germany, just as he did in Spain, and the
    measures which he took against it, such as arbitrary arrests, and the
    shooting of the bookseller Palm, only exasperated the new national
    patriotism.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Marriage of Napoleon with Marie Louise, 2nd April 1810.</div>

  <p>The Emperor, as has been said, was a great believer in the hereditary
    idea, and his not having children to succeed him was more than a
    personal, it was a political subject of grief to him. The campaign
    of Wagram had raised him to the height of his power, and he wished
    to establish his dynasty on a firm foundation. It was therefore for
    personal, for political, and for European motives, that he resolved
    on his return from Vienna in 1809 to divorce his wife, the Empress
    Josephine. It was from no dislike for his wife, but from a stern
    conviction of political necessity that he took this step. He insisted,
    that Josephine should preserve her title of Empress, he granted her
    Malmaison as her palace, with a large income, and he continued his
    favours to his step-children, Eugène de Beauharnais, and Hortense, the
    wife of his brother Louis Bonaparte. On the 15th of December 1809 the
    divorce was pronounced on the ground that the religious marriage,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
    which had taken place on the day before his coronation as Emperor, was
    not valid because of the absence of witnesses. The Emperor’s first
    intention was to wed a Russian grand duchess. He was still enamoured
    of his idea of dividing the world with the Emperor Alexander, and
    considered that a relationship with that monarch would best ensure
    his power. But the Emperor Alexander was beginning to throw off his
    infatuation for Napoleon. He now perceived, that in the alliance he had
    made, he gave more than he got, and various causes of discontent were
    sedulously fomented by his Court and his family. It was further the
    custom of the Russian Court for the mothers to have the chief choice
    in the disposing of their daughters’ hands. Now the Empress-mother
    was a princess of the House of Würtemburg, and had imbibed a profound
    hatred for the French Emperor. She persuaded her son to throw various
    delays in the path of the Emperor’s desires without actually rejecting
    his offer. Under these circumstances, Napoleon abruptly changed his
    mind, and at the suggestion, it is said, of Prince Schwartzenberg,
    the Austrian ambassador at Paris, demanded the hand of an Austrian
    archduchess. The Emperor Francis thought it necessary to yield, and
    on the 2nd of April 1810, the marriage took place between the French
    Emperor and the young Archduchess Marie Louise. The ceremony was
    of the utmost magnificence, and a new Court was formed for the new
    Empress, which contained many French nobles who had refused to wait
    on Josephine. On the 20th of March 1811, a son was born to the French
    Emperor who was created in his cradle King of Rome, and this birth was
    regarded by Napoleon as finally cementing his power, both in France and
    in Europe.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Peninsular War, 1810–1812.</div>

  <p>During the period from the Treaty of Vienna in 1809 to the invasion
    of Russia in 1812, Napoleon had but one declared enemy. The English
    Ministers, despite the overthrow of Austria and Prussia, and the
    alliance between France and Russia, persisted in opposing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span> France.
    Just as Pitt and Grenville could not believe in the stability of the
    various French revolutionary governments, and therefore maintained
    the impossibility of concluding permanent peace with France, so their
    successors, Wellesley and Castlereagh, also declined to believe in
    the stability of Napoleon’s Empire, and argued that no permanent
    peace could be made with him. It is just possible, that while Fox
    was in office in 1806, a peace might have been concluded, but the
    succession of his victories had inspired Napoleon with a belief in his
    own invincibility, and he had no idea of negotiating on any basis but
    the complete recognition of his reconstitution of Europe. Finding it
    impossible to break the naval power of England, he endeavoured to ruin
    her commerce by the Continental Blockade, with the result of increasing
    England’s prosperity, and turning the people of the Continent against
    him.</p>

  <p>Two methods of carrying on the war were supported by Castlereagh and
    Canning, who were Secretaries of State in the Portland administration
    from 1807 to 1809. Canning believed in rousing the national feeling of
    invaded states against the universal conqueror, and for this purpose
    sent large sums of money to Spain; Castlereagh, on the other hand,
    thought that as France could no longer meet England at sea, England
    must meet France on the land. This was the theory which lay at the
    bottom of the despatch of the first Portuguese and of the Walcheren
    Expeditions, and in spite of the failure of the latter, it has since
    been recognised as a correct theory. The victory of Wellington at
    Talavera, though it had but little actual result on the course of the
    war in Spain, kept Portugal free from French invasion during the year
    1809. But it did more, it inspired the English governing class with
    the belief that they had at last discovered the right way of fighting
    Napoleon, and that they had also found a general. Lord Wellesley,
    the elder brother of Wellington, who was Foreign Secretary from 1809
    to 1812, supported the new system with all his might, and under his
    encouragement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span> Wellington slowly formed the Anglo-Portuguese army by
    a series of campaigns into a magnificent fighting machine, which,
    though smaller in numbers than the Grand Army of France, equalled it in
    discipline and military efficiency.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Campaign of 1810.</div>

  <p>Napoleon, after his successes in 1808, despised the Spanish levies
    and the English army. He therefore declined to go in person to the
    Peninsula, and sent his greatest marshal, Masséna, to drive the English
    out of Portugal. A plan of campaign was formed, by which Masséna was to
    penetrate Portugal from the north-east, while Soult was to advance from
    Andalusia in the south-east. The two marshals were to meet at Lisbon.
    Fortunately for Wellington, not only did Soult not agree with Masséna,
    but the latter marshal found it impossible to control his subordinates,
    Ney, Junot, and Reynier. Masséna nevertheless marched in the summer of
    1810, and Wellington had to fall back before him. On September 27th,
    Masséna was repulsed in an attack upon the Anglo-Portuguese position at
    Busaco, but the English general felt it necessary to retreat further,
    to the lines which he had fortified in the neighbourhood of Lisbon,
    which are known as the lines of Torres Vedras. As Wellington retired,
    the Portuguese devastated their country, and when Masséna came to a
    halt in front of the lines of Torres Vedras, he found it most difficult
    to maintain himself on account of the scarcity of provisions. Soult
    did not come to his help as he had expected, but only advanced as far
    as the city of Badajoz, which he captured. Throughout the winter of
    1810–11, Masséna remained in front of Wellington, but, in spite of
    reinforcements, he was unable to attack the Anglo-Portuguese lines, and
    in the spring of 1811, had to retreat into Spain.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Campaign of 1811.</div>

  <p>Wellington then divided his army; with one portion he followed Masséna,
    and laid siege to Almeida, the other he despatched under Marshal
    Beresford to form the siege of Badajoz. In the south of Spain, the
    only city which held for the Junta was Cadiz, which was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span> defended by
    an Anglo-Spanish army. Marshal Victor was in charge of the besieging
    force, which was defeated at Barrosa on the 5th of March 1811. In
    spite of this diversion, Wellington had to meet fresh advances by the
    main armies of Soult and Masséna. On the 5th of May 1811, he repulsed
    Masséna at Fuentes de Onor after a hard-fought battle, which Masséna
    might have won had he been properly supported by Marshal Bessières. In
    the south, Soult was repulsed by Beresford at the battle of Albuera
    on May 16th. After having thus once more freed Portugal from French
    invasions, Wellington laid siege successively to Ciudad Rodrigo and
    Badajoz. Though these border fortresses remained in French hands,
    the valour of the Anglo-Portuguese army surprised Napoleon, who
    recalled Masséna in disgrace. But in the east of Spain his generals
    met with some success. Suchet in 1810 and 1811 reduced Arragon and
    Valencia, took many fortresses, and destroyed the Spanish army in
    that quarter, under the command of General Blake, at the battle of
    Albufera. Throughout central Spain, though no regular Spanish armies
    took the field, the French were harassed by the Spanish guerillas.
    These patriotic brigands destroyed the morale of the French troops in
    Spain and sapped the strength of Napoleon. All the benefits conferred
    by Joseph Bonaparte, the abolition of feudalism and of the Inquisition,
    religious tolerance and good laws, counted for nothing. The Spaniards
    would receive no benefits from a French monarch imposed on them by
    Napoleon, and it was in Spain that Napoleon first felt the effect of a
    national opposition, which was at a later date in Russia and in Germany
    to destroy his power.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Conclusion.</div>

  <p>The period from the Conference of Erfurt to the invasion of Russia
    seemed to mark the height of Napoleon’s power, but during it are to
    be perceived the symptoms of the changes which led to his fall. At
    Erfurt, Alexander of Russia was still his firm ally. His power was
    bounded by subject kingdoms, and divided by them from the great states
    of Europe. In France he was still regarded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span> as the restorer of order
    and the supporter of religion. By 1812 the situation had changed. The
    Emperor Alexander was no longer his admirer and faithful ally. The
    vast extension of the Empire had weakened his power, and the French
    people were beginning to discover how dearly they were paying in the
    sacrifice of their individual liberty for the glory of one man. His
    wanton interference in Spain had raised a new force against him in the
    shape of the resistance of a nation, and had afforded the English an
    opportunity to meet him on land. In Germany, too, a national spirit
    was rising, and Prussia, which he had maltreated, was reorganised, and
    ready to set itself at the head of Germany. But there was one cause yet
    more significant which was developed during this period—the character
    of his soldiers was altered. The Grand Army, which had consisted of
    veterans trained in the wars of the Revolution, had wasted away at
    Austerlitz and Jena, Eylau and Friedland, and in the Spanish campaigns.
    At Wagram he felt how different were the men under his command, and was
    forced to depend largely on foreign contingents, of whose fidelity he
    could not be certain; and he was to find in 1812 that the conscripts of
    the Empire, though full of military ardour and desirous of rivalling
    the fame of their predecessors, had not the physical strength, the
    solidity, and the experience of the veterans who had made him Emperor
    of the French and Master of Europe.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Gradual disagreement between Alexander and Napoleon.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> causes of the disagreement between Napoleon and the Emperor
    Alexander dated back to the Treaty of Tilsit. At that time, though
    personally full of enthusiasm for the French conqueror, Alexander
    looked with suspicion on the formation of the Grand Duchy of Warsaw
    as a possible first step towards the restoration of Poland. Napoleon
    pointed out to him that he could obtain compensation in the direction
    of Sweden and of Turkey—a suggestion which led to the conquest of
    Finland and eventually of Bessarabia. Though Alexander carried out
    the projects proposed to him, he continued to resent the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span> creation of
    the Grand Duchy of Warsaw, and still more the maintenance of French
    troops in that quarter. At the Congress of Erfurt Napoleon to some
    degree allayed the suspicions of his ally, but on his return to Russia
    there can be no doubt that Alexander looked upon himself as duped and
    badly treated. The war of 1809 widened the breach. Napoleon complained
    that the Russian troops promised for his assistance had not acted with
    vigour, and Alexander regarded with open discontent the cession of part
    of Austrian Galicia to the Grand Duchy of Warsaw. The dethronement of
    the Duke of Oldenburg, who had married Alexander’s favourite sister,
    the Grand Duchess Catherine, and the absorption of his Duchy into
    the French Empire, in 1810, was another and more personal cause of
    disagreement. The delay in granting a Russian grand duchess to him
    in marriage was looked on by Napoleon as a personal slight, and his
    interference in Spain appeared to the Russian Emperor a sign that
    Napoleon could maltreat even his most faithful ally. The carrying
    out of the Continental Blockade embittered the situation. Napoleon
    complained that the Russians did not adhere loyally to the arrangement
    for the exclusion of English commerce. Alexander on his side complained
    that his country was being ruined by the blockade, while the French
    Emperor granted many licences to Frenchmen to trade with England.</p>

  <p>To these political reasons must be added the personal characters of
    the two emperors. Napoleon, though he had spoken at Tilsit of dividing
    Europe between France and Russia, began, as his power increased, to
    devise schemes for securing the Empire of Europe for himself and the
    exclusion of Russia from any share. Instead of restoring the Empires
    of the East and West, Napoleon arrogated to himself the position of
    ruler of Europe, and spoke of thrusting Russia back into Asia. In these
    views he was encouraged by many of those surrounding him. His marshals,
    finding no profits to be got from Spain, looked forward to enriching
    themselves in Russia. His statesmen, either from motives of their own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
    or to please his personal wishes, declared that France could not be
    safe until Russia was crushed. Alexander on his side was surrounded by
    bitter enemies of Napoleon. His ministers never wearied of emphasizing
    the ruin caused to Russia by the Continental Blockade. The King of
    Prussia, whom he had made his personal friend, pleaded for the complete
    restoration of his dominions. His family, and especially his mother,
    regarded Napoleon as the enemy of the human race; English agents were
    perpetually inciting the Russians to declare for commercial freedom;
    and three of the most accomplished and most able statesmen in Europe
    constantly urged him to war with France, namely, Stein, whom Napoleon
    had ordered the King of Prussia to dismiss; Pozzo di Borgo, a Corsican,
    who had known Napoleon in his youth, and who hated him as a personal
    enemy; and Nesselrode, a skilled diplomatist and an intimate friend of
    Metternich.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Policy of Castlereagh.</div>

  <p>These various causes, both political and personal, might not then
    have led to war had it not been for the direct intervention of the
    English by means of the new Prince Royal of Sweden, Bernadotte. Lord
    Castlereagh, in January 1812, returned to office. He advocated the
    carrying on of the war against Napoleon, not only by reinforcing
    Wellington in the Peninsula, but by subsidizing the monarchs of the
    Continent. He therefore despatched three diplomatists to the three
    chief courts of the Continent, to endeavour to form a fresh coalition
    against Napoleon. These were his brother, Sir Charles Stewart,
    ambassador to Berlin, Lord Aberdeen to Vienna, and Lord Cathcart to
    St. Petersburg. Lord Cathcart was a distinguished military officer,
    and strenuously urged Alexander to declare war, and he brought with
    him several English officers to assist in reorganizing the Russian
    army, of whom the best known is Sir Robert Wilson. But it was rather
    through Sweden than directly that Castlereagh influenced the Emperor
    Alexander. Bernadotte, on being elected Prince Royal, had applied to
    Sweden the Continental Blockade against England, but he soon perceived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
    how ruinous that policy was to his new country, and inclined to make
    some arrangement with England. Being unable to break with Napoleon
    by himself, Bernadotte acted as the intermediary between England and
    Russia, and in April 1812 signed a secret treaty with Alexander at
    Abo, by which Sweden renounced all claims on Finland on condition
    that Russia should promise Norway in its stead. Both England and
    Russia approved of this scheme. Frederick <span class="smcap">VI.</span> of Denmark,
    who had succeeded his father, Christian <span class="smcap">VII.</span>, in 1808, had,
    after the capture of the Danish fleet in 1807, formed a most intimate
    alliance with Napoleon, and Alexander at Abo held out to Bernadotte,
    not only a hope that he might have the whole of Denmark as a result
    of successful war against the French, but even an expectation that
    he might eventually receive the throne of France as a reward for his
    services. Not less important than the English intervention in Sweden
    was the effect of English influence in Turkey; for it was through
    English mediation that the Treaty of Bucharest was signed in May 1812,
    which allowed the Emperor of Russia to concentrate all his military
    power against Napoleon.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Prussia. The Ministry of Hardenberg.</div>

  <p>Between France and Russia there remained, however, Austria, Poland, and
    Prussia. Though Napoleon’s direct domain extended to Lübeck along the
    coast, he had not ventured to annex Germany proper, which lies between
    the Elbe and the Rhine, or to accept the title of German Emperor, in
    addition to that of the Emperor of the French and King of Italy, as
    had been suggested by the Prince Primate, Dalberg. Yet Germany proper,
    owing to his creation of the Confederation of the Rhine and the Kingdom
    of Westphalia, was so thoroughly under his influence that, from a
    military point of view, it might be regarded as part of his Empire.
    Austria, Poland, and Prussia were, however, more independent, and his
    first effort, when he decided to attack Russia, was to secure their
    active co-operation. The Emperor Francis, since the campaign of Wagram,
    had abandoned the idea of resistance. He feared and disliked the
    Russians;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span> Napoleon was his son-in-law, and he did not intend to oppose
    his wishes. He therefore promised willingly enough that an Austrian
    army should invade Russia to the south of the direct French invasion.
    In the Grand Duchy of Warsaw the Poles cared little for their Grand
    Duke, the King of Saxony; they looked to Napoleon for the restoration
    of their complete independence, and delighted in the thought of
    striking a blow at their old foes, the Russians. In Prussia the
    position was more complicated. Reduced as the kingdom was, the reforms
    of Stein and Scharnhorst had created a national feeling, which could
    not as yet be utilised in attacks on the French soldiers who occupied
    the Prussian fortresses. Stein himself had been driven from Prussia by
    Napoleon’s orders, but a successor, Hardenberg, completed his work. It
    is significant that when Hardenberg was reappointed State Chancellor in
    1810, he did not undertake the Foreign Office, as he had done in 1806,
    but the ministries of the Finance and the Interior. It was Hardenberg
    who in 1810 made the nobles subject to taxation, and brought Stein’s
    promised Representative Assemblies into partial use; who, on 23rd
    January 1811, suppressed the Teutonic Order, and made its possessions
    part of the national domain; and who, on 11th September 1811, achieved
    the logical result of Stein’s edict abolishing serfdom by granting
    the peasants power to become absolute proprietors of two-thirds of
    their holdings on surrendering the other third to the lords in full
    recognition of all feudal dues and servitudes.</p>

  <p>Hardenberg’s most ardent coadjutor was William von Humboldt. As Stein
    and Hardenberg had done the work of the French Revolution in Prussia
    by abolishing feudalism and securing equality before the law, so
    William von Humboldt established a national system of education in
    many respects similar to Napoleon’s creation in France, and reformed
    the whole department of public instruction. At the head of the system
    was founded the University of Berlin. Prussia had deeply felt the loss
    of the University of Halle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span> when that city was separated from Prussia
    by the Treaty of Tilsit. Königsberg, though made famous by Kant, was
    too distant from the centre of the reduced kingdom to fill its place,
    and the new national spirit was concentrated in the new University of
    Berlin. Learned men came from all parts of Germany. Savigny, Fichte,
    Wolf, Buttmann, Boeckh, Schleiermacher, and Niebuhr all enrolled
    themselves as professors; and Germany, not merely Prussia, found a
    worthy representative in the world of thought.</p>

  <p>In the resurrection of Prussia King Frederick William <span class="smcap">III.</span>
    merely acquiesced in the reforms of Stein and Hardenberg. But his
    former leaning to neutrality had given place to a desire for revenge
    on the French. In July 1810 he lost his patriotic wife, Queen Louise,
    and her death only exasperated his feelings. Nevertheless, he refused
    to declare himself on the side of Russia in 1812. The Emperor Alexander
    announced his policy of allowing the French to invade, and his
    intention of thus drawing Napoleon far from his base, and Frederick
    William felt that he was not strong enough to openly oppose the French
    Emperor. He was even constrained by the occupation of his fortresses
    to go further, and, on 24th February 1812, he signed an offensive and
    defensive alliance with Napoleon. By this treaty Prussia was not only
    to feed the French armies passing through her dominions to invade
    Russia, but to send an army of 30,000 men to act with them. Alexander
    was not displeased by this behaviour. He knew that Prussia could not
    help itself; he felt a sincere friendship for the hapless king; he
    understood that beneath the surface, not only Prussia, but all Germany
    was boiling with indignation against the French; and in 1812, when war
    was at hand, he summoned the inspirer of German national feeling, the
    great Prussian minister, Stein, from his exile in Austria to become his
    adviser and coadjutor in his German policy.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Invasion of Russia. May 1812.</div>

  <p>Without any actual declaration of war, Russia entered into negotiations
    with England, and Napoleon assembled a vast army<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span> on the banks of the
    Vistula. In May 1812 he entered Germany to take the command, and at
    Dresden had interviews with the King of Prussia and the Emperor of
    Austria. Of the 325,000 men with whom he crossed the river Niémen and
    invaded Russia only 155,000 were French; the remainder were foreign
    contingents. He detached to his left Marshal Macdonald, with the
    Prussian contingent and some Westphalians and Poles, to attack Riga and
    advance on St. Petersburg, with the hope of joining Bernadotte and the
    Swedes; he was supported on his right by the Austrian subsidiary force,
    and with the centre of his army he advanced in person into Lithuania.
    That province being occupied, Napoleon crossed the Dnieper, and on the
    18th of August he took Smolensk, in spite of the efforts of a Russian
    army of 80,000 men to cover the city. On his extreme right the Austrian
    army, under Prince Schwartzenberg, was checked by the arrival of the
    Russian army, set free by the Peace of Bucharest. The Russian generals,
    Barclay de Tolly and Bagration, in the centre, steadily retreated.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Battle of Borodino. 7th Sept. 1812.</div>

  <p>This military policy soon reduced the efficiency and numbers of the
    French army; for it was drawn further from its base into a barren
    country, in which it was harassed by peasants and guerillas, and it
    was necessary to leave large divisions to protect the communications.
    The Emperor Alexander had approved of this policy, and as the Russian
    army retired the people abandoned their villages, as the Portuguese had
    done during the invasion of Masséna in 1810. But the Russian soldiers
    grumbled at this politic retreat, and the Emperor Alexander resolved
    to strike one blow for his capital. Barclay de Tolly was replaced by
    Kutuzov, and the Russian army suddenly halted on the banks of the
    Mosková. On the 7th of September a most terrible battle was fought
    there, which is known as the battle of Borodino. The Russians are said
    to have lost 50,000 men, including General Bagration, and it is certain
    that the French lost more than 30,000. Nevertheless, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span> French loss
    was proportionately the most; for Napoleon was far away from any
    reinforcements, whereas the Russians were fighting in their fatherland.
    On the 14th of September the French army occupied Moscow. On the
    16th, either by accident or on purpose, fire broke out in the Russian
    capital. It raged for three days and three nights, and more than
    three-fifths of the city was utterly destroyed. The Emperor Alexander
    then entered into negotiations with Napoleon, and, whether he intended
    it or not, he kept the French Emperor from moving until too late for
    his safety. It was not until the 15th of October that Napoleon saw that
    negotiating was waste of time, and started from Moscow. The winter was
    an early one. Snow fell heavily. When Smolensk was reached, it was
    found that all the provisions stored there had been destroyed. The
    retreating army, now in a state of disorganisation, was hunted through
    the country, not only by the Russian soldiers, but by the peasantry
    returning to their homes. Marshal Ney covered the retreat, and won
    on this occasion his title of ‘the bravest of the brave.’ Napoleon,
    on being informed that a conspiracy against him, headed by General
    Malet, had been discovered in Paris, left the retreating army early in
    December. After his departure the cold increased. The retreat became
    a rout; Murat, who succeeded to the command, could not keep the army
    together; and but very few of the 155,000 Frenchmen who had invaded
    Russia recrossed the river Niémen.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Campaign in the Peninsula. 1812.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Battle of Salamanca. 22d July 1812.</div>

  <p>While Napoleon was wrecking one army in Russia, Wellington was
    defeating another French army in Spain. Marmont, who had succeeded
    Masséna, failed to prevent the fall of Ciudad Rodrigo in January,
    or that of Badajoz in April, and after a long course of intricate
    manœuvres, gave Wellington the opportunity to attack and defeat him
    at the battle of Salamanca, July 22, 1812. The victory was complete.
    Joseph Bonaparte evacuated Madrid, and withdrawing all his troops from
    Andalusia fell back behind the Ebro. Wellington occupied Madrid on
    August 12, and then with his main army<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span> advanced on Burgos. Burgos,
    however, resisted all his assaults. The Anglo-Portuguese army had to
    retire once more into Portugal, and Joseph Bonaparte for the last
    time returned to his capital. While this campaign was being fought
    Lord William Bentinck, who commanded the English garrison in Sicily,
    was requested to send troops to the eastern coast of Spain to effect
    a diversion. But the operations were badly combined; Sir John Murray
    was driven from before Tarragona; and at a subsequent date Lord
    William Bentinck himself failed to make an impression on Suchet’s army
    at Alicante. The victory of Salamanca was a proof of the insecure
    foundation on which the throne of Joseph Bonaparte rested. Owing to it
    alone he had to leave Madrid, and evacuate the whole of southern Spain;
    the military policy of the English ministers was justified; and though
    Salamanca cannot be compared with the disasters in Russia, it yet had
    its effect in showing the increasing weakness of the French military
    power.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Prussia declares war. 16th March 1813.</div>

  <p>The retreat of the French and their passage of the Niémen enabled
    Prussia to throw off the mask of alliance with France. The Prussian
    contingent, amounting to 18,000 men, had been placed under the command
    of Marshal Macdonald, and was occupied in the siege of Riga. Napoleon
    had hoped that this detached army upon his left would be joined by
    Bernadotte at the head of the Swedes. But Bernadotte, as has been seen,
    had forgotten his French nationality in accepting the position of heir
    to the Swedish throne. His first idea was to make himself popular in
    Sweden by securing the conquest of Norway to take the place of Finland,
    and behind it lay the hope of possibly succeeding Napoleon himself.
    In his original communications with the Emperor Alexander, he had
    demanded the assistance of a Russian army for the conquest of Norway
    as the price of his adhesion to the coalition against Napoleon. When
    Alexander would not make a definite promise, Bernadotte applied to his
    former sovereign in June 1812, and promised to assist in the French
    invasion of Russia, if Napoleon would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span> guarantee to him the possession
    of Norway. But the French Emperor would make no compact with his former
    marshal, and hoped that he would lend his assistance to the occupation
    of St. Petersburg in return for vague promises. Bernadotte therefore
    remained neutral, and Macdonald, without the expected help from Sweden,
    could get no further than Riga. The retreat of the main French army
    from Moscow made it necessary for Macdonald likewise to fall back, and
    in the course of his retreat the Prussian contingent, under the command
    of General York, deserted, and that general signed the Convention of
    Tauroggen, on 30th December 1812, by which he abandoned France without
    definitely declaring himself upon the side of Russia. Macdonald, with
    his Westphalians and Poles, managed to leave Russia in safety, and
    to join the remnants of the main army. But the desertion of York was
    a symptom of what was to follow. Stein summoned the Estates of East
    Prussia at Königsberg; the Prussians rose <i>en masse</i>, and the French
    army, pursued by the Russian troops and these new enemies, retreated
    behind the Vistula.</p>

  <p>Frederick William of Prussia at last threw off the mask, and, on the
    7th of February 1813, he called out the reserve which had been formed
    by the skilful military policy of Scharnhorst, and ordered the Landwehr
    and the Landsturm to join the colours; on 27th February he signed the
    Treaty of Kalisch with Russia, promising alliance; on 16th March he
    declared war against France; and he joined the headquarters of his
    friend Alexander, and lived in his company until the termination of the
    war. Prussian enthusiasm grew to its height; the reserves fell in from
    every city and district, and the broken French army, which was now left
    under the command of Eugène de Beauharnais, retreated first behind the
    Oder and then behind the Elbe, leaving powerful garrisons in Dantzic,
    Stettin, and the chief Prussian fortresses. The Russians of the army
    of the right pursued vigorously, and after driving the French from
    Berlin, the Russian generals, Chernishev and Tetterborn, took Hamburg.
    The resurrection of Prussia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span> and the rapid retreat of the French caused
    Bernadotte to declare himself openly on the side of the allies, and he
    crossed the Baltic and entered Germany at the head of a Swedish army of
    12,000 men. The King of Prussia’s declaration of war with France was
    received with enthusiasm. Two separate Prussian armies were formed,
    the first under Bülow to act with the Swedes, and the Russian army of
    the right, and to defend Berlin, the other under Blücher in Silesia to
    co-operate with the second invading army of the left from Russia. The
    command in chief of this latter army was, after the death of Kutuzov in
    May, conferred on Barclay de Tolly, while Wittgenstein commanded the
    Russian contingent.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">First Campaign of 1813.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Armistice of Pleswitz. 3d June 1813.</div>

  <p>In the spring of 1813 Napoleon started for Germany to face the new
    coalition. His Westphalian, Bavarian, and Saxon allies were still true
    to him and increased their contingents. He called to his assistance the
    old soldiers who were employed in the garrisons of Holland and Northern
    Germany, and he raised a large number of fresh conscripts, who, in
    spite of their youth and inexperience, were at once directed upon
    Germany. At the head of 250,000 men, eventually increased to 300,000,
    he invaded Saxony. He defeated Wittgenstein at Lutzen or Gross Görschen
    on the 2d of May, at which battle his friend, Marshal Bessières was
    killed, and Scharnhorst was mortally wounded, and reoccupied Saxony. He
    defeated the whole of the allied army of Silesia at Bautzen on the 20th
    of May, and established his headquarters at Dresden. Meanwhile Vandamme
    had recaptured Hamburg, and, after placing it in a state of defence,
    joined the Emperor in Saxony. After these vigorous blows both sides
    desired a rest, and on the 3d of June the Armistice of Pleswitz was
    signed, and it was agreed that a congress should be held at Prague to
    consider if terms of peace could not be arranged. The important point
    to be decided at Prague was the position to be adopted by Austria; and
    both sides prepared to offer a high price for her active assistance,
    for her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span> intervention would probably settle the result of the war.
    Napoleon trusted that his father-in-law, the Emperor Francis, would
    not abandon him, and counted upon the assistance of an Austrian army.
    He relied also upon the hereditary hatred of Austria for Prussia, and
    promised his father-in-law, as the price of his active assistance,
    not only the restoration of the Illyrian provinces, but of the whole
    of Silesia, which Frederick the Great had torn from Maria Theresa.
    Napoleon was even sanguine enough to count upon the former friendship
    which the Emperor Alexander had felt for him, and he hoped that the
    invasion of Russia would be forgiven if he guaranteed the possession
    of the whole of Poland. The country which would be sacrificed by these
    arrangements was Prussia. Napoleon projected the entire extinction of
    the Prussian kingdom, and suggested that the kingdom of Westphalia
    should be extended to the Oder. That he should venture to offer such
    terms showed how entirely Napoleon misunderstood his position. The
    Emperor Francis, although his daughter was Napoleon’s wife, could not
    forget the humiliations that Austria had undergone, and allowed his
    feelings as an Austrian to outweigh his sentiments as a father. The
    Emperor Alexander had been entirely cured by the invasion of Russia of
    his former infatuation, and now distrusted the French Emperor as much
    as he had formerly believed in him; he had struck up an intimacy with
    the King of Prussia, and had promised him his restoration to the whole
    of his dominions.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Convention of Reichenbach. 17th June 1813.</div>

  <p>Meanwhile the rulers of Austria, Russia, and Prussia signed a treaty at
    Reichenbach on 17th June 1813, by which Austria assumed the position
    of a mediator and promised to declare war against France, if the
    conditions of peace, which she should offer, were rejected. In return
    for this attitude, Austria was given a free hand to negotiate with
    the South German States, and the idea of rousing a national German
    feeling against France, which was strongly advocated by Stein, was
    abandoned. Metternich had no liking for the national idea; it seemed
    to him to bear the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span> imprint of the spirit of the French Revolution,
    and could only end in disaster to Austria. The rising of Prussia had
    indeed been a success, but if it spread through Germany, it might
    end in a united Germany with Prussia at its head, and the consequent
    depreciation of the Austrian power. The example of Spain, which Stein
    and patriotic Germans pointed to, seemed to cut in two ways; if, on
    the one hand, it had raised a people in arms against Napoleon, on the
    other it had encouraged revolutionary ideas. Both the Emperor Alexander
    and King Frederick William felt the weight of these arguments, and the
    conception of the war changed from a national uprising to a coalition
    of the usual type. Under these circumstances, Napoleon’s propositions
    were ignored, and proposals were made to him on the other hand that he
    should be content with the natural limits of France, namely, the Rhine
    and the Alps; that he should restore the Bourbons to Spain and the
    independence of Holland; that he should abandon his position as head of
    the Confederation of the Rhine and allow the Pope to return to Rome.
    Murat was to remain at Naples, and Jerome on the throne of Westphalia,
    and the terms offered were by no means unfavourable to France, though
    perhaps hardly justified by the military position of the allies.
    Metternich, who perceived that Austria held the key to the position,
    brought these terms to Napoleon’s headquarters at Dresden, and informed
    the Emperor that if they were not accepted, Austria would join the
    coalition against him.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Austria declares war.</div>

  <p>Napoleon refused with scorn; Castlereagh, through the English
    ambassador, Lord Aberdeen, promised large subsidies to Austria; and
    on the 1st of August 1813, the Emperor of Austria promised definitely
    to join the allies with 200,000 men if Napoleon refused to accept the
    terms offered to him. The Congress met at Prague. Caulaincourt, the
    French plenipotentiary, stated that he had no power to accept the terms
    offered by Francis, and Austria, on the 12th of August, declared war
    against France. On the 14th of August, when it was too late, Napoleon
    declared his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span> acceptance of the terms, and received the answer that the
    whole matter must be referred to the allied monarchs. War in fact was
    inevitable, and the Armistice of Pleswitz was at an end.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Second Campaign of 1813 in Germany.</div>

  <p>The intervention of Austria not only deprived Napoleon of an expected
    ally, but endangered his military position in Saxony, as a strong
    Austrian army was being concentrated in Bohemia under the command of
    Prince Charles von Schwartzenberg. Nevertheless the French Emperor
    refused to retire, and prepared at the head of 300,000 men to make face
    against the allies in spite of their great superiority in number. The
    plan of campaign of the allies was drawn up by Moreau, who had been
    induced to leave America and give the advantage of his advice to the
    Czar of Russia. There was also upon the staff of the Russian army one
    of the ablest strategists in Europe who, like Moreau, had formerly
    been an officer in the French army, General Jomini. The plan was to
    direct an army from the north, of Prussians, Russians and Swedes, under
    Bülow, Chernishev, and Bernadotte, an army from the east of Russians,
    called the Army of Poland, which was being formed under Benningsen,
    an army from Silesia, of Prussians under Blücher, and Russians under
    Wittgenstein, and finally an army of Austrians under Schwartzenberg,
    assisted by the Russian main army of Barclay de Tolly, and the Russian
    Imperial Guard under the Grand Duke Constantine, upon Dresden. But
    Napoleon with his accustomed rapidity of action determined to strike
    first, and he detached three corps under Oudinot, Macdonald and
    Vandamme, against Bernadotte, Blücher, and Schwartzenberg; Benningsen
    was too far in the rear to be dangerous. Oudinot and Macdonald were
    defeated by Bernadotte and Blücher at Gross-Beeren and the Katzbach
    respectively, on the 23d and 25th of August, and Schwartzenberg,
    instead of waiting for the other armies, attacked the French centre at
    Dresden. On the 26th and 27th of August a terrible battle was fought,
    in which Moreau was mortally wounded. Napoleon was successful, but he
    suffered severe losses which he was unable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span> to repair. Three days later
    he received the news that Vandamme’s army, which had penetrated into
    Bohemia to cut off Schwartzenberg’s communications, had been forced to
    capitulate at Kulm to the Russians under Barclay de Tolly. The battle
    of Dresden proved to the allies that it was impossible for one of their
    armies to overthrow Napoleon unassisted, and they therefore recurred to
    their original plan. Napoleon once more endeavoured to break from his
    defensive position and struck at Berlin; but Marshal Ney was defeated
    by Bernadotte and Bülow at Dennewitz, on 6th September, and he had
    to wait while the ring formed round him. The Emperor’s losses during
    the first part of this campaign had been immense. He had lost over
    10,000 men by the capitulation of Kulm; his young soldiers had been
    decimated at the Katzbach and Dennewitz; and the troops of the German
    contingents deserted <i>en masse</i>. In fact when the operations of the
    allies were completed and their armies had concentrated around Leipzig,
    to which place he had withdrawn, he had not more than 160,000 men,
    whose confidence was shaken by repeated defeats, to oppose to more than
    double that number.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Treaty of Töplitz. 19th Sept. 1813.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Battle of Leipzig. 16th-19th October 1813.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Battle of Hanau.</div>

  <p>After the battle of Dresden, the army of Schwartzenberg retired into
    Bohemia, and the allied monarchs determined to define their position
    as to the future. The enormous armies they were concentrating made
    them feel sure of success, if they held together. On 9th September the
    important Treaty of Töplitz was signed. By this treaty it was agreed
    that Prussia and Austria should be restored as nearly as possible to
    the limits they had held in 1805, that the Confederation of the Rhine
    should be dissolved, and that entire independence should be granted
    to the states of southern and western Germany. This decision overcame
    the lingering hesitation of the south German monarchs, who had feared
    retaliation from the allies for their consistent adhesion to Napoleon.
    Of these states, Bavaria was the chief, and on 8th October the Treaty
    of Ried was signed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span> between Austria and Bavaria, by which Bavaria
    promised the aid of 36,000 men in return for complete indemnity and the
    recognition of complete sovereignty in her dominions. Then the allies
    in their full strength attacked Napoleon. For three days, from the 16th
    to the 19th of October, the terrible battle of Leipzig was fought. The
    result was a foregone conclusion, and even without the desertion of the
    Saxons in the course of the battle, the ruin of the French army was
    certain. Napoleon’s forces were not only defeated, they were destroyed,
    and in the utmost disorder the routed French divisions fled in a state
    of disorganisation across Germany. At this moment Maximilian Joseph
    of Bavaria, whom Napoleon had made a king, declared against him as
    he had promised, and not only withdrew the Bavarian contingent, but
    endeavoured to check the French retreat. At the battle of Hanau on
    October the 30th, however, the remnant of the French army broke through
    the Bavarians, and it eventually found safety behind the Rhine.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Insurrection of Germany against Napoleon 1813.</div>

  <p>The battle of Leipzig was followed by a general rising throughout
    central Europe against the French. The secret societies which had
    been formed to promote the idea of the freedom of Germany acted in
    every direction. Many isolated regiments of the French army were
    cut off and the French garrisons in the various German cities were
    closely besieged. The benefits which had been conferred by French
    administration were forgotten and the people thought only of the
    humiliation of the French occupation. Nor was this spirit confined
    to Germany. The Dutch rose in rebellion, and declared in all the
    chief cities of Holland for the Prince of Orange. That prince at once
    left England and set himself at the head of the insurgents, and Lord
    Castlereagh a few months later sent to his assistance an English
    force under the command of Sir Thomas Graham to reduce the few Dutch
    fortresses still occupied by French garrisons. In Italy also an almost
    universal insurrection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span> broke out against the French domination. Lord
    William Bentinck, who commanded the English army which occupied Sicily,
    sailed to Genoa with a powerful force and encouraged the insurgents
    in that quarter. Meanwhile an Austrian army under General Hiller
    invaded Italy from the north-east and defeated Eugène de Beauharnais
    at Valsarno on the 26th of October. Against this unanimity of national
    opposition Napoleon could make but little headway; the French people
    were tired of the conscription; they had not approved of the invasion
    of Russia; and were indisposed at the moment of crisis to support the
    Emperor.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Campaign in the Peninsula 1813.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Battle of Vittoria. 21st June.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Wellington invades France. Oct. 1813.</div>

  <p>While the French armies were suffering the succession of disasters
    which expelled them from Germany, a similar series of catastrophes
    occurred in Spain. Wellington broke up from his quarters in the summer
    of 1813, and marching in a north-easterly direction attempted to
    cut off all communication between France and Madrid. This movement
    completely overthrew the French domination in Spain. Joseph Bonaparte
    with all the troops he could collect fled from Madrid. He was unable to
    defend himself behind the Ebro as in 1812, for the positions on that
    river had been skilfully turned. Wellington eventually came up with
    the French army at Vittoria. There Marshal Jourdan, who commanded for
    King Joseph, endeavoured to resist, but he was completely defeated by
    the Anglo-Portuguese army on the 21st of June 1813. This victory drove
    the French back into France, for Suchet was likewise obliged to abandon
    his conquests in Valencia, and to retire into the mountains of Arragon
    and Catalonia. The victory in the field was followed as in Germany
    by a burst of national enthusiasm. The Spanish guerillas destroyed
    every isolated French post, and even managed to place some serviceable
    divisions at the disposition of Wellington. The English general took up
    a position on the French frontier between Pampeluna and San Sebastian,
    blockading the former and besieging the latter place. To face him Soult
    was sent to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span> south-west of France to defend the frontier. On the
    31st of August San Sebastian was stormed; Pampeluna speedily fell;
    and Wellington was able to establish a new base of operations, and to
    invade France. On the 10th of November the Anglo-Portuguese army drove
    Soult from his positions on the Nivelle, and after the battles of the
    Nive or Saint Pierre from the 9th to the 13th of December Wellington
    invested Bayonne.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Negotiations for Peace.</div>

  <p>These repeated disasters in different quarters induced Napoleon to
    consider the advisability of concluding a peace. He was now only too
    ready to accept the terms offered to him at the Congress of Prague.
    The allies were by no means so united as they seemed. The Austrian
    Minister Metternich, in particular, was not desirous of destroying the
    power of France. England had no wish to come to any conclusion which
    should disproportionately increase the strength of Russia, and the aim
    of all the allied monarchs was to allow France to develop in her own
    way as long as she withdrew her pretensions to interfere in Europe.
    Metternich’s proposals, in November 1813, were that France should
    preserve her natural limits of the Rhine and the Alps, but should
    restore all former rulers in Holland, Italy, and Spain. Napoleon gave
    evidence of his desire for peace at this period by the dismissal of
    his Foreign Secretary, Maret, Duc de Bassano, and the appointment of
    Caulaincourt, Duc de Vicenza, who was known to be in favour of peace
    and was also a personal friend of the Emperor Alexander, at whose Court
    he had been ambassador during the palmy days of the alliance between
    France and Russia. The terms of peace offered by Metternich, which
    are known as the Proposals of Frankfort, at which city the allied
    monarchs were residing, were confided to M. de Saint-Aignan, a French
    diplomatist who had been taken prisoner during the advance of the
    allies and who was the brother-in-law of Caulaincourt. The proposals
    were definitely acceded to by Lord Aberdeen on the part of England and
    by Hardenberg on the part of Prussia. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span> favourable nature of them
    was dictated by the fear entertained by the allied monarchs that France
    would rise in her might as she had done in 1793 if her borders were
    invaded. For this reason the allies remained for some weeks upon the
    right bank of the Rhine, concentrating their forces and hesitating to
    advance. Napoleon, however, could not understand that he was beaten.
    Instead of replying at once to the Proposals of Frankfort, which were
    dated the 9th of November, it was not until late in December that he
    instructed Caulaincourt to go to the allied quarters and discuss them.
    His instructions to Caulaincourt showed how little he appreciated the
    position of affairs. He demanded that, in addition to the natural
    limits of France, he should hold the cities of Wesel, Cassel opposite
    Mayence, and Kehl opposite Strasbourg on the right bank of the Rhine,
    which fairly signified that he did not abandon his projects on Germany.
    He further demanded that a kingdom should be formed for his brother
    Jerome in Germany, and for Eugène de Beauharnais in Italy. Before these
    counter-propositions reached the headquarters of the allied monarchs,
    they had resolved to invade France, and the opportunity was gone for
    ever for France to attain her natural limits under the sanction of
    Europe.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Invasion of France 1814. First Campaign.</div>

  <p>The attitude of the allies, as indicated in the Proposals of Frankfort,
    was mainly dictated by Metternich, who did not desire to see his
    Emperor’s son-in-law dethroned or to see France greatly weakened.
    But the Emperor Alexander and his friend, the King of Prussia, soon
    repented of the assent they had given to Metternich’s ideas. Alexander
    desired to invade France as a reply to the invasion of Russia in 1812,
    and hoped to occupy Paris as Napoleon had occupied Moscow. The King
    of Prussia, and still more his generals and ministers, had felt most
    keenly the humiliating condition to which Prussia had been degraded,
    and desired to wreak their vengeance on France. It was therefore agreed
    that since the Proposals of Frankfort had not been promptly accepted,
    the result of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span> successful invasion of France should be the return of
    that country into the limits she possessed at the beginning of the wars
    of the Revolution. The attitude of Russia and Prussia was that adopted
    by England. Lord Castlereagh heard with dismay, that it was intended
    to allow France the limits of the Rhine, for by that concession she
    would hold Belgium and Antwerp, which it had been the consistent policy
    of all English Ministers for many generations to keep independent of
    France. The barrier treaties of former days, and the wars against Louis
    <span class="smcap">XIV.</span> had been sustained for the purpose of keeping France
    out of the Belgian Netherlands, and the English cabinet resolved to
    continue this classic policy. For this purpose, Lord Castlereagh was in
    person despatched to the headquarters of the allied monarchs, with the
    greatest powers ever granted to a British statesman. He was given ‘full
    powers to negotiate and conclude of his own authority, and without
    further consultation with the government, all conventions or treaties,
    either for the prosecution of war or for the restoration of peace.’<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

  <p>Lord Castlereagh sailed from Harwich on the 31st of December 1813, on
    which day Blücher with the main Prussian army, known as the Army of
    Silesia, crossed the Rhine in three columns at Coblentz, Mannheim, and
    Mayence. Blücher was supported by three Russian <i>corps d’armée</i>, but
    it was further south that the main Russian army in conjunction with
    the Austrians invaded France under the command of Schwartzenberg. It
    was not without some difficulty that the Emperor Alexander was induced
    to consent to the violation of the neutrality of Switzerland. But the
    military arguments put forward by his generals overcame his scruples.
    By marching through Switzerland, Schwartzenberg’s army was enabled to
    turn the mountains of the Jura, and to leave the French fortresses
    on the Rhine, behind him. This invasion on two distinct lines gave
    Napoleon the opportunity <span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>of carrying out one of the military manœuvres
    of which he was most fond. He concentrated between the two invading
    armies a force of between 50,000 and 70,000 men. This was a terrible
    falling off from the vast armies with which he had invaded Russia in
    1812, and fought the allies in Saxony in 1813; it was a falling off not
    only in numbers, but in military efficiency, for with the exception
    of the remnant of the Guard, he had only under his command some
    regiments of conscripts and national guards untrained to war. At this
    period Napoleon bitterly repented the mistake he had made, in leaving
    over 150,000 veteran soldiers as garrisons in the various fortresses
    in Europe. The presence of these men would very likely have turned
    the scale. He had left, for instance, 12,000 men in Hamburg under
    the command of Marshal Davout, 16,000 in Magdeburg, 8000 in Dantzic,
    and large garrisons in other distant cities, such as Stettin. These
    fortresses were blockaded by local militia; their occupation did not
    withdraw many regular troops from the allied armies, while it fatally
    weakened the resources of France.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Napoleon’s Victories in France. 1814.</div>

  <p>Nevertheless, with his boy conscripts and his Guard, Napoleon fought
    one of his greatest campaigns. Blücher foolishly scattered his troops,
    after his entry into Champagne. Napoleon quickly took advantage of
    his mistake. He cut up division after division of Blücher’s army
    at Brienne, Champaubert, Montmirail, and Vauchamps, between the
    29th of January and the 14th of February, and then turning against
    Schwartzenberg, who had also scattered his forces, he defeated a
    Russian division at Nangis, and an Austrian division at Montereau
    on the 17th and 18th of February. These rapid blows startled and
    disconcerted the allies. Blücher’s army was practically destroyed;
    Schwartzenberg fell back, and asked for an armistice; and proposals
    were made for the evacuation of France. It was only the constancy of
    the Emperor Alexander and the determination of Lord Castlereagh which
    induced the allies to persist. Two <i>corps d’armée</i>, one of Prussians
    under Bülow, the other of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span> Russians under Wintzingerode, were on
    Lord Castlereagh’s sole authority detached from Bernadotte’s army
    and ordered to reinforce Blücher. Meanwhile, Alexander insisted that
    Schwartzenberg should concentrate instead of retiring. In reality,
    Napoleon’s successes were more fatal to himself than to the allies,
    for they induced him to break off the negotiations at the Congress of
    Châtillon.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Other movements against Napoleon. 1814.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Bernadotte.</div>

  <p>While the first campaign of 1814 was being fought out in France, the
    movement against Napoleon was becoming general. Bernadotte had after
    the victory of Leipzig been placed in command of the army in northern
    Germany. Full of the idea which had been suggested to him by the
    Emperor Alexander in 1812, that he might succeed Napoleon on the throne
    of France, Bernadotte did not wish to appear before his own countrymen
    in the light of an invader. He had occupied himself for some weeks
    after the battle of Leipzig with blockading Davout in Hamburg, and
    fighting the Danes in Holstein. Even if he could not obtain the throne
    of France, he was quite resolved to win Norway, and for this purpose
    he attacked the Danes, and after some fighting, compelled Frederick
    <span class="smcap">VI.</span> of Denmark to sign the Treaty of Kiel on 14th January
    1814, by which Denmark ceded Norway to Sweden, in exchange for Swedish
    Pomerania. Bernadotte even went so far as to negotiate with Davout, to
    whom he promised a free passage to France with all his troops as the
    price of the surrender of Hamburg. But the Emperor Alexander would not
    submit to this, and Bernadotte was imperiously ordered only to leave a
    blockading force before Hamburg, and to advance to the French frontier.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Holland.</div>

  <p>It was at this juncture that Bernadotte was deprived of his two finest
    <i>corps d’armée</i>, which were ordered up to the assistance of Blücher.
    But in addition to the danger threatened by Bernadotte’s army, Napoleon
    also met with serious opposition in the Netherlands. The Dutch people
    declared for the Prince of Orange, and Holland was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span> quickly lost.
    A force under the command of the Prince marched into Belgium, and
    besieged Antwerp, which was defended by the former member of the
    Committee of Public Safety, Carnot, who, though neglected by Napoleon
    in the days of his greatness, had come to the help of France in the
    time of her distress. To assist the Prince an English division under
    Sir Thomas Graham had, as has been said, been despatched to Holland.
    Graham failed to take Bergen-op-Zoom on the 20th of February, but
    his presence in the Netherlands not only encouraged the Dutch, but
    prevented Napoleon from obtaining help from that quarter.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Augereau.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Wellington wins battle of Orthez. 27th February</div>

  <p>In the south, Marshal Augereau, whom the Emperor had placed in
    command at Lyons, was, as he himself said, no longer the Augereau of
    Castiglione. He had been directed to make a diversion against the
    Austrian left as it entered France with some conscripts and troops
    drawn from the former Army of Spain, but he remained inactive, and his
    operations were of no assistance to the Emperor. In the south-west
    corner of France, Soult was unable to do more than make head against
    Wellington and the Anglo-Portuguese army. After the battles of the Nive
    or of Saint Pierre, Bayonne was completely invested, and Wellington,
    leaving the left of his army to carry on the siege, marched eastwards
    against Soult. That marshal had been weakened by the detachments
    he had been ordered to send to Augereau, and to Napoleon himself.
    Nevertheless, he made a gallant stand at Orthez on the 27th of
    February, but was defeated and forced to fall back further into France.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Italy.</div>

  <p>In Italy the Viceroy, Eugène de Beauharnais, who in the retreat from
    Russia had given evidence that he was a general of the very first
    order, offered a gallant resistance to the Austrians under General
    Hiller. But the defection of the King of Bavaria, his father-in-law,
    opened the passes of the Tyrol to the Austrians, and Eugène de
    Beauharnais was then compelled to retreat. At the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span> commencement of
    1814, Metternich entered into negotiations with Murat, the King of
    Naples. Through the influence of his wife, Caroline Murat, sister of
    Napoleon, with whom Metternich had been in most intimate relations
    when he was ambassador at Paris, Murat, in the hope of preserving
    his kingdom, issued a violent proclamation against his benefactor,
    Napoleon, and advanced to the banks of the Po, at the head of a
    Neapolitan army of 80,000 men. This movement caused Eugène de
    Beauharnais, whose fidelity to his stepfather shines out in bright
    contrast to the treachery of Murat, to fall back still further. He
    defeated the Austrians under Marshal Bellegarde on the Mincio on the
    8th of February, but was unable to follow up his success owing to the
    position of Murat. In his rear, Lord William Bentinck had landed at
    Genoa and issued a proclamation promising independence to that city,
    and the support of England in securing the independence and unity of
    Italy. Napoleon at one time thought of calling Eugène de Beauharnais to
    his side, but his rapid victories over the isolated <i>corps d’armée</i> of
    the allies in February caused him to abandon this wise project.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Congress of Châtillon. 3d Feb.-19th March 1814.</div>

  <p>It has been said that one effect of Napoleon’s victories was to break
    up the Congress of Châtillon. It had been suggested that a congress
    should meet at Mannheim at the time of the Proposals of Frankfort, but
    Napoleon’s delay prevented it from assembling until after the invasion
    of France was an accomplished fact. The success of this invasion
    altered the attitude of the allies towards France. They saw that the
    French nation was not going to arise in its might as it had done in
    1793. They heard through sure hands that the people were almost in open
    rebellion against the Emperor. The Legislative Body had dared to oppose
    his wishes. Everywhere the conscription was evaded, and there was a
    muttered feeling throughout France that the country had had enough of
    war and that it was time that the blood-tax on the French youth should
    cease. Even the army itself was beginning to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span> despair. The Emperor had
    lost his prestige in Russia and at Leipzig. His soldiers were not the
    veterans of his former wars; his generals and his marshals began to
    murmur and to fear that a war <i>à outrance</i> would end in their personal
    ruin. Under these circumstances the Congress of Châtillon met on the 3d
    of February 1814. The French plenipotentiary was Caulaincourt, the most
    upright of Napoleon’s statesmen. The other powers nominated, not their
    chief ministers, Metternich, Nesselrode, Hardenberg, and Castlereagh,
    although they were all at headquarters, but subordinate diplomatists,
    namely, Count Philip Stadion, the predecessor of Metternich, for
    Austria, William von Humboldt for Prussia, Razumovski for Russia, and
    Lord Cathcart, Lord Aberdeen, and Sir Charles Stewart for England.</p>

  <p>At Châtillon very different conditions from the Proposals of Frankfort
    were offered. The main stipulation was that France should return to
    her limits before the Revolution. England haughtily declared that the
    naval question with regard to the rights of neutrals was not to be
    mentioned, and everything was made subject to the great question of
    the French limits. Caulaincourt disputed the proposals on the ground
    that it was unfair that France should be reduced to the limits she had
    held in 1789 while the other powers had been so vastly increased by
    the rearrangement of Germany and the partition of Poland. Nevertheless
    he was most anxious that Napoleon should accept these proposals. He
    granted that they were worse than the Proposals of Frankfort, but
    argued that if the war continued they were likely to be worse still.
    Napoleon, however, looked upon the Congress as an opportunity for
    gaining time. He believed that by his military successes he would avert
    the disasters which threatened him, and on the day of the battle of
    Montereau, the 18th of February, he wrote that he was only willing
    to agree to a peace on the basis of the Frankfort Proposals, and in
    his own handwriting he added to his despatch to Caulaincourt, ‘Sign
    nothing.’<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> It <span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>is worthy of note that in the Proposals of Châtillon
    nothing was said about Napoleon himself. The Emperor Francis assumed
    that his son-in-law would remain upon the throne of France, and Lord
    Castlereagh expressed no view to the contrary. But the English Minister
    was absolutely determined not to yield to Napoleon’s demand for the
    natural limits of France. England was the paymaster of the coalition,
    and Castlereagh having just promised £10,000,000 to pay the military
    expenses of 1814 felt that he had the right to insist on his demand.
    Napoleon in after years declared that his persistence in retaining
    Belgium was the reason for his refusal to accede to the Proposals of
    Châtillon. ‘Antwerp,’ he said to Las Cases, ‘was to me a province in
    itself; it was the principal cause of my exile to Saint Helena, for
    it was the required cession of that fortress which made me refuse the
    terms offered at Châtillon. If they would have left it to me peace
    would have been concluded.’<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Metternich wrote to Caulaincourt
    pressing the acceptance of the Proposals of Châtillon, but Napoleon
    obstinately refused, and the Congress had practically failed by the
    beginning of March, though it did not actually break up until the 19th
    of that month.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Attitude of France towards Napoleon.</div>

  <p>The fact that the French nation did not rise in arms against the
    invaders has been mentioned as the primary cause for the difference
    between the terms offered at Frankfort and at Châtillon. Nothing proves
    more completely how thoroughly Napoleon had extinguished the spirit of
    the Revolution than the lukewarmness with which his call to arms was
    received in 1814. In 1793 the invasion of France had caused a frenzy of
    patriotism. The people had submitted to the Reign of Terror, because
    it meant a strong government which could expel the English, Prussians,
    and Austrians. France was at that time hemmed in by difficulties
    infinitely greater than those which she had to face in 1814. Then
    she had no great general. In 1814 she possessed one of the greatest
    generals <span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>the world has ever seen. In 1793 she was torn by civil war
    in La Vendée and by brigands in every sparsely populated district. In
    1814 she had enjoyed fifteen years of internal tranquillity. In 1793
    her finances were utterly disordered, her industries were destroyed,
    and the whole country a prey to anarchy. In 1814 she had been for years
    the chief nation in Europe, and the wealth of other countries had
    been drained to enrich her. But the difference was that in 1793 and
    the succeeding years the French people felt that they were fighting
    to ward off the interference of foreign nations in their internal
    affairs, whereas in 1814 they were called on to defend the power of
    a single man who had infringed the rights and the freedom of other
    nations. By his bureaucratic system Napoleon had crushed out the power
    of popular initiative which had been the strength of the Republic; by
    his suppression of individual liberty he had made the majority of the
    French people disaffected to his Empire.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Exhaustion of France.</div>

  <p>There must be considered also the exhaustion of actual physical
    resources. In the campaigns of 1812 and 1813, it is estimated that
    nearly 750,000 Frenchmen were either killed, wounded, or taken
    prisoner. Before that time the Grand Army had been slowly destroyed
    on many a field of battle, and there simply were not sufficient men
    of military instinct and physical strength to fill the ranks. In
    1813 Napoleon enrolled the conscripts whose turn would have come in
    1815—mere boys of sixteen, who had melted away after the battle of
    Leipzig—and the men he called to the ranks in 1814 were those who had
    been passed over by the conscription in previous years, and were too
    long inured to civil life to be willing to serve as soldiers.</p>

  <p>To the feeling that resistance to the invaders was not a national
    duty, must be added a general indisposition to support the Empire. The
    opinions which had found vent during the French Revolution had not been
    extinguished by the Empire; they had only been suppressed; and all
    the educated part of the nation was united in desiring representative
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>institutions so as to exercise a share in directing the policy of the
    government. This opinion showed itself in the Legislative Body which
    was summoned in December 1813. Napoleon had announced that his cause
    was the cause of France; but in return the leaders of the Legislative
    Body only begged him to make peace. A paragraph was inserted in the
    report of the Legislative Body upon the Proposals of Frankfort, which
    contains the following words: ‘It belongs to the Government according
    to the Constitution to propose the most effectual means to repel the
    enemy and secure peace. These means will only be effectual if the
    French people are convinced that their blood will be shed only to
    defend the country and our protective laws. It appears, therefore,
    indispensable that at the same time that His Majesty shall propose
    the most prompt and efficacious measures for the safety of the State,
    the Government should be besought to maintain the entire and constant
    execution of the laws which guarantee to the French people the rights
    of liberty, security, and property, and to the nation the complete
    enjoyment of its political rights. That guarantee appears the most
    effectual means for restoring to the French people the energy necessary
    for their defence in the present crisis.’ Napoleon was much irritated
    by this attack on his arbitrary authority, and although this paragraph
    was expunged from the report by 254 votes to 223 he nevertheless
    dissolved the Legislative Body in a rage.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Bourbons.</div>

  <p>Neither at the Congress of Châtillon nor in the Legislative Body was
    a single word said about restoring the Bourbons. They had lost all
    credit during their exile. The French people did not want them. The
    allied powers did not care about them. By Lord Castlereagh’s orders
    Wellington received the Duc d’Angoulême, son of the Comte d’Artois, in
    his camp in the south of France, but he distinctly refused to recognise
    him in any way whatever. The English general went further and issued
    a proclamation in which he declared that the war was being waged for
    security to Europe, not for a change of dynasty in France, and that no
    interference was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span> either intended or would be permitted in the free
    decision of the French people with regard to their internal government.
    When the Duc d’Angoulême was favourably received in Bordeaux and the
    Mayor of that city hoisted the white flag, Wellington wrote to the
    Bourbon prince defining his attitude and censuring the assertion in the
    Duke’s proclamation, that he was supported by England.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Treaty of Chaumont. 1st March 1814.</div>

  <p>In spite of his real weakness Napoleon was so infatuated by his
    successes in February 1814 that, as has been said, the Congress came to
    an end, but he was not far wrong in his estimation of the effect of his
    victories upon the allied monarchs. So profoundly was Schwartzenberg
    terrified by the destruction of Blücher’s army and the victories of
    Nangis and Montereau that he wished to retreat from France. Differences
    between the powers at this juncture threatened to break up the
    coalition, and it was only the determination of Lord Castlereagh that
    kept them together. The English minister on the 1st of March 1814
    concluded the secret Treaty of Chaumont. By this treaty the relations
    of the allied monarchs to each other on several points were defined,
    and though many fresh causes of dissension arose at a later date, it
    was the Treaty of Chaumont which kept the powers together until the
    overthrow of Napoleon, and which laid the basis of the final settlement
    at Vienna. By this treaty the four great powers, England, Russia,
    Austria and Prussia, bound themselves, if France refused to return
    within her ancient limits, to form an offensive and defensive alliance.
    Each member of the coalition was to maintain 150,000 men in the field,
    and England bound herself, in addition to paying her own contingent
    and maintaining her navy, to contribute a subsidy of £5,000,000 a year
    to be divided equally amongst the other three contracting parties.
    As England by this arrangement offered more than twice as much as
    any other country, Castlereagh practically became the master of the
    coalition. After peace was concluded each of the powers was to furnish
    a contingent of 60,000 men if any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span> one of them were attacked. The
    resettlement of Europe was to be arranged on the following bases: that
    the German Empire should be restored as a federal union; that Holland
    and Belgium should be united into a monarchy under the House of Orange;
    that Spain should be restored to its ancient sovereign; that Italy
    should be divided into independent states; and that Switzerland should
    be guaranteed as independent and neutral by all the great powers.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Occupation of Paris by the Allies.</div>

  <p>The result of the Treaty of Chaumont was to stiffen the attitude of
    the allies in France. All thought of retreat was abandoned and both
    the Austrians under Schwartzenberg, and the Army of Silesia under
    Blücher recommenced their advance upon Paris. Napoleon pursued the
    tactics which had been crowned with success in the month of February,
    and prepared to strike at each of the invading armies in turn. His
    first movement as before was against Blücher. The Army of Silesia
    had been reduced by the actions of Champaubert, Montmirail, etc.,
    from 60,000 to 30,000 men, but it was now increased to more than its
    former number by the arrival of Saint Priest’s Russians and of the
    two corps of Bülow and Wintzingerode which had been detached from
    Bernadotte by Lord Castlereagh. Napoleon was not aware of the extent
    of these reinforcements, and he therefore with his army of barely
    30,000 men ventured to attack Blücher. On the 7th and 9th of March,
    the severe actions of Craonne and Laon were fought. Neither side won
    victories, but Napoleon failed to repeat his former successes, which
    was tantamount to a defeat. After the battle of Laon both Blücher and
    Napoleon reviewed the armies at their disposal, and the disparity of
    their strength is shown by the fact that whereas Blücher reviewed
    109,000 men, Napoleon found that including all reinforcements, he had
    but 46,000. Having failed to check the Prussians, Napoleon turned to
    attack Schwartzenberg’s army. On the 20th of March he fought an action
    at Arcis-sur-Aube, in which the Russians repulsed the French attack.
    The Emperor then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span> resolved on a final effort. He determined to attack
    the lines of communication of the invaders, and marched towards the
    Vosges Mountains. But the invaders were in too strong force to be
    terrified by this manœuvre. A few divisions only were left to watch
    him, and the main armies continued their advance on Paris. On March
    the 30th, Schwartzenberg and Blücher arrived in front of the French
    capital. They had under their command about 200,000 men, whereas
    Marshals Marmont and Mortier, who had been charged with the defence of
    Paris, could not get under arms more than 28,000 including the National
    Guard. In spite of this enormous difference of strength the two
    marshals took up a position and prepared to defend Paris. But after the
    most obstinate resistance the allies carried the French position after
    ten hours’ fighting on the 30th of March, and on the following day
    the Emperor Alexander and the King of Prussia entered Paris. Napoleon
    rapidly followed the allied army, but the occupation of Paris was fatal
    to his cause. He was ready to continue the war, but his marshals were
    not. On the 4th of April Ney, Macdonald, Oudinot, and Lefebvre had an
    interview with the Emperor, and told him that the army would fight no
    more. Napoleon was obliged to give heed to their remonstrances, and he
    sent Ney, Macdonald, and Caulaincourt to make what arrangements might
    be possible with the allied monarchs.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Provisional Government at Paris.</div>

  <p>On entering Paris the Emperor Alexander and King Frederick William
    proceeded at once to the residence of Talleyrand. That astute
    statesman quickly decided upon a definite policy. He understood that
    the allies had hitherto treated with Napoleon, and that they were not
    favourably disposed to the Bourbons. He knew that the French nation
    did not desire the return of the former dynasty. But he felt that the
    only method which would enable France to take up a logical position
    on the Continent was by the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy. If
    Louis <span class="smcap">XVIII.</span> were accepted as King of France, it would be a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
    contradiction in terms to their professed belief in hereditary rights,
    and their hatred for the results of the Revolution, for the allied
    monarchs to attack the unity of France. For this reason Talleyrand
    persuaded Alexander that it would be inadmissible either to accept the
    government of the Empress Marie Louise in the name of her son, the King
    of Rome, or still less to recognise Alexander’s candidate, Bernadotte.
    In his own words to the Emperor: ‘Any attempt to create a Regency or to
    appoint Bernadotte is a mere intrigue; nothing remains but Bonaparte or
    the Bourbons.’ Alexander then declared that he would no longer treat
    with Napoleon, and Talleyrand as Vice-Arch-Chancellor of the Empire
    summoned the Senate to meet upon the 1st of April.</p>

  <p>The Senate at once elected a Provisional Government consisting of
    Talleyrand as President and the Comte de Bournonville, former War
    Minister of the Republic, the Comte de Jaucourt, a former leader of
    the Legislative Assembly, the Abbé de Montesquiou, a former leader of
    the Constituent Assembly, and the Duc de Dalberg, nephew of the Prince
    Primate of Germany. The Senate then resolved that, whatever government
    should be adopted, the sale of the national and ecclesiastical estates
    in the days of the Revolution should be ratified, the liberty of
    worship and of the press established, and a general amnesty declared.
    On the following day the Emperor Alexander addressed the Senate. He
    said: ‘It is neither ambition nor the love of conquest which has
    led me hither; my armies have only entered France to repel unjust
    aggressions. Your Emperor carried war into the heart of my dominions
    when I only wished for peace. I am a friend of the French People; I
    impute their faults to their chief alone; I am here with the most
    friendly intentions; I wish only to protect your deliberations. You
    are charged with one of the most glorious missions which generous men
    can discharge,—that of securing the happiness of a great people, in
    giving France institutions, at once strong and liberal, with which she
    cannot dispense in the advanced state of civilisation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span> to which she has
    attained.’ Alexander in conclusion, as a sign of his goodwill, declared
    that he would release the 150,000 French prisoners of war then in
    Russia.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Abdication of Napoleon. 6th April 1814.</div>

  <p>That evening the Senate solemnly declared Napoleon to be no longer
    Emperor, and formed a Provisional Ministry, including Comte Beugnot,
    Minister of the Interior, Baron Louis, Minister of Finance, and General
    Dupont, who had been disgraced for the Capitulation of Baylen, Minister
    for War. Matters had reached this stage when Napoleon’s emissaries
    Ney, Macdonald, and Caulaincourt, arrived at the headquarters of the
    allied monarchs. These faithful adherents proposed that Napoleon
    should abdicate in favour of his infant son. This offer, which would
    have been gladly received some days before, was now rejected, owing
    to the influence of Talleyrand, and on April the 6th, when Napoleon
    received the news of this rejection, he unconditionally abdicated
    at Fontainebleau. This step was made necessary by the fact that the
    faithful marshals could not even speak in the name of the whole army on
    behalf of Napoleon. Marshal Marmont, who had distinguished himself in
    the great battle before Paris, had made separate terms for himself and
    placed his army at the disposal of the allies. The desertion of Marmont
    deprived Napoleon of the greater part of the forces on which he relied,
    and rendered his unconditional abdication necessary.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Provisional Treaty of Paris. 11th April 1814.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Battle of Toulouse. 10th April 1814.</div>

  <p>The abdication of Napoleon was followed by the arrival of Lord
    Castlereagh in Paris. The English minister had since the breaking up of
    the Congress of Châtillon remained at the headquarters of the Emperor
    of Austria at Dijon. It was there that he had entered into intimate
    relations with Metternich, relations which were to lead to most
    important results. On the 11th of April 1814, the Provisional Treaty
    of Paris was signed. It was essentially a treaty between the Emperor
    Napoleon, through his plenipotentiaries, and the allied monarchs.
    It was not a treaty with France, for Louis <span class="smcap">XVIII.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span></span> had not
    arrived from England, or been recognised as king, and the Provisional
    Government could only enter into provisional arrangements. By this
    treaty, which was signed by Caulaincourt, Macdonald, Ney, Metternich,
    Nesselrode, Hardenberg, and Castlereagh, Napoleon renounced for himself
    and his descendants the Empire of France and the Kingdom of Italy. He
    was, however, to retain the title of Emperor; the island of Elba was
    erected into an independent principality for him, and an income of
    £180,000 a year was granted to him. The duchies of Parma and Piacenza
    were secured in full sovereignty to the Empress Marie Louise, and after
    her decease to the King of Rome, and the divorced Empress Josephine was
    given an annuity of £40,000 a year. On the day before this treaty was
    signed, April 10th, 1814, the Battle of Toulouse was fought. Wellington
    after his victory of Orthez had rapidly followed Soult into the heart
    of Southern France. When he attacked the French positions in front of
    Toulouse, he was ignorant of the great events which had been passing at
    Paris and at Fontainebleau, and it was only after his entrance into the
    city that he perceived the white cockade was being worn.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Arrival of Louis XVIII.</div>

  <p>On the 20th of April 1814, Napoleon bade farewell to the Guard at
    Fontainebleau, and started for Elba, and on the 24th his successor,
    Louis <span class="smcap">XVIII.</span>, who had not entered France since his escape
    in 1791, landed at Calais. The new King was eminently fitted by his
    natural character, which had been matured by his long exile, for a
    constitutional monarch, but unfortunately he was surrounded by men who
    had shared his exile, and who did not share his placable disposition.
    On the 2d of May, when he had reached the neighbourhood of Paris, Louis
    <span class="smcap">XVIII.</span> published what is known as the Declaration of St. Ouen.
    In this declaration, he promised a constitution to the French people,
    which should provide among other things for a representative government
    with two chambers, complete liberty of worship and the press,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span> the
    right of the representatives to grant taxation, the inviolability of
    all property, including national and ecclesiastical estates, which had
    been sold during the Revolution, the responsibility of the ministers,
    irremoveability of the judges, and complete equality before the law.
    On the following day, he entered Paris amid general rejoicings, for
    the French people had forgotten their grievances of olden time in the
    memory of their more recent sufferings in the latter years of Napoleon.
    He was not in any way treated with by the Provisional Government; his
    return was tacitly accepted as inevitable; and he returned to the
    Tuileries as of divine right, without any bargain being made with him.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">First Treaty of Paris. 30th May 1814.</div>

  <p>The first important duty which fell to Louis <span class="smcap">XVIII.</span> was
    the signature of a definitive treaty of peace with the allies. The
    evacuation of French territory by the invaders had been arranged with
    the Provisional Government on the 23d of April, and the foreign troops
    were already beginning to retire. By the definitive Treaty of Paris,
    which was negotiated by Talleyrand on behalf of Louis <span class="smcap">XVIII.</span>,
    it was agreed that France should return to her limits of 1792. By
    this arrangement, the early annexations of the Revolution before the
    outbreak of war were secured to France. These additions included
    Avignon and the County of the Venaissin, which had formerly belonged
    to the Pope, and several districts in Alsace, of which the most
    noteworthy were the Principality of Montbéliard formerly the property
    of the King of Würtemberg, and the Republic of Mulhouse. France also
    received Chambéry, and part of Savoy, with certain rectifications of
    the frontier in the neighbourhood of Geneva, and on the north-eastern
    border. All the former French colonies, except the islands of the
    Mauritius, Tobago, and Saint Lucia, were restored to France. With
    regard to other countries, it was agreed, as had been laid down in the
    Treaty of Chaumont, that Germany was to become a Confederacy instead of
    an Empire, that Holland and Belgium were to be united, that Italy was
    to be divided into independent states,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span> and that the independence of
    Switzerland was to be guaranteed by all the great powers. At the same
    time that this treaty was signed, a secret treaty was agreed to between
    the four invading powers, without consulting France. This secret treaty
    dealt largely with the future apportionment of the territories on the
    left bank of the Rhine which had been administered by France ever since
    1794. It was roughly agreed that these provinces should be annexed to
    Prussia, and it was further laid down, that Austria should possess the
    whole of Lombardy, and that Genoa should be united to Sardinia. The
    details of this arrangement, and the many other questions which were
    certain to arise were adjourned, and it was settled that they should be
    considered at a great congress which was to meet at Vienna.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Conclusion.</div>

  <p>The two nations which had done the most to overthrow the excessive
    power of Napoleon were England and Russia, and the two men most
    conspicuously concerned were the Emperor Alexander and Lord
    Castlereagh. The two rival German powers, Austria and Prussia,
    naturally inclined to different sides. Prussia was the declared ally of
    Russia; the Emperor Alexander and the King Frederick William had formed
    one of the romantic personal friendships which Alexander loved; and
    the Russian and Prussian ministers were in perfect accord in desiring
    to punish France and her allies, and to aggrandise themselves. Austria
    on the other hand naturally inclined to support England. Both feared
    the increasing preponderance of Russia; both felt that enough had
    been done in deposing Napoleon, and did not desire to wreak vengeance
    on France; both were inclined to be moderate in their demands. This
    rivalry between Russia with Prussia, and Austria with England had
    appeared in its incipient stages before the Treaty of Chaumont, and it
    was to rise to its height during the Congress of Vienna. The return of
    the Bourbons to France was to have an important result on the rivalry
    between the allies, and it is a significant proof of the inherent
    power of France, and of the greatness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span> of the ascendency which she had
    won, that she was enabled at Vienna to act the most decisive part. The
    overthrow of Napoleon had not really weakened France; she had lost her
    natural territorial limits of the Rhine and the Alps which she might
    have obtained but for the stubbornness of Napoleon; nevertheless, she
    was still strong enough to be feared, and in the day of her greatest
    disaster she was able to exert a greater influence in the affairs of
    Europe than she had ever done since the time of Louis <span class="smcap">xiv.</span></p>

   <div class="sidenote">Congress of Vienna.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">On</span> the 1st of November 1814 the diplomatists who were to resettle
    Europe as arranged by the definitive Treaty of Paris met at Vienna.
    But many of the monarchs most concerned felt that they could not
    give their entire confidence to any diplomatist, however faithful or
    distinguished, and they therefore came to Vienna in person to support
    their views. The final decision of disputes obviously lay in the hands
    of the four powers which by their union had conquered Napoleon. These
    four powers solemnly agreed to act in harmony and to prepare all
    questions privately, and then lay them before the Congress. In fact
    they intended to impose their will upon the smaller states of Europe
    just as Napoleon had done. That they did not succeed and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span> their
    concert was broken was due to the extraordinary ability of Talleyrand,
    the first French plenipotentiary. The history of the Congress is the
    history of Talleyrand’s skilful diplomacy, and the resettlement of
    Europe which it effected was therefore largely the work of France.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Monarchs and Diplomatists present.</div>

  <p>The Emperor Francis of Austria acted as host to his illustrious
    guests. The royalties present were the Emperor Alexander of Russia,
    with his Empress, the Grand Duke Constantine, and his sisters, the
    Grand Duchesses Marie of Saxe-Weimar and Catherine of Oldenburg; the
    King of Prussia with his nephew Prince William; the King and Queen of
    Bavaria, the King and Crown Prince of Würtemburg, the King of Denmark,
    the Prince of Orange, the Grand Dukes of Baden, Saxe-Weimar, and
    Hesse-Cassel, the Dukes of Brunswick, Nassau, and Saxe-Coburg. The King
    of Saxony was a prisoner of war and absent.</p>

  <p>The plenipotentiaries of Russia were Count Razumovski, Count von
    Stackelberg, and Count Nesselrode, who were assisted by Stein, the
    former Prussian minister, and one of Alexander’s most trusted advisers,
    by Pozzo di Borgo, the Corsican, now appointed Russian ambassador to
    Paris, by Count Capo d’Istria, the future President of Greece, by
    Prince Adam Czartoryski, one of the most patriotic Poles, and by some
    of the most famous Russian Generals, such as Chernishev and Wolkonski.
    The Austrian plenipotentiaries were Prince Metternich, the State
    Chancellor, the Baron von Wessenberg-Ampfingen, and Friedrich von
    Gentz, who was appointed to act as Secretary to the Congress.</p>

  <p>England was represented by Lord Castlereagh, Lord Cathcart, Lord
    Clancarty, and Lord Stewart, Castlereagh’s brother, who as Sir Charles
    Stewart had played so great a part in the negotiations in 1813, and who
    had been created a peer for his services. The English plenipotentiaries
    were also aided by Count von Hardenberg, and Count von Münster,
    who were deputed to represent Hanoverian interests. The Prussian
    plenipotentiaries were Prince von Hardenberg, the State<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span> Chancellor,
    and William von Humboldt, who in military matters were advised by
    General von Knesebeck. The French representatives, whose part was to be
    so important, were Talleyrand, Prince of Benevento, the Duc de Dalberg,
    nephew of the Prince Primate, the Marquis de la Tour du Pin, and the
    Comte Alexis de Noailles. These were the representatives of the great
    powers. Among the representatives of the lesser powers may be noted
    from the importance of their action, Cardinal Consalvi, who represented
    the Pope, the Count of Labrador for Spain, Count Palmella for Portugal,
    Count Bernstorf for Denmark, Count Löwenhielm for Sweden, the Marquis
    de Saint-Marsan for Sardinia, the Duke di Campo-Chiaro for Murat,
    King of Naples, Ruffo, for Ferdinand King of the Two Sicilies, Prince
    von Wrede for Bavaria, Count Wintzingerode for Würtemburg, and Count
    von Schulemburg for Saxony. In addition to these plenipotentiaries
    representing powers of the first and second rank, were innumerable
    representatives of petty principalities, deputies for the free cities
    of Germany, and even agents for petty German princes mediatised by
    Napoleon in 1806.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">History of the Congress.</div>

  <p>When Talleyrand with the French legation arrived in Vienna he found,
    as has been said, that the four great powers had formed a close union
    in order to control the Congress. His first step therefore was to set
    France forth as the champion of the second-rate states of Europe. The
    Count of Labrador, the Spanish representative, strongly resented the
    conduct of the great powers in pretending to arrange matters, as they
    called it, for the Congress. Talleyrand skilfully made use of Labrador,
    and through him and Palmella, Bernstorf and Löwenhielm managed to upset
    the preconcerted ideas of the four allies, and insisted on every matter
    being brought before the Congress as a whole, and being prepared by
    small committees specially selected for that purpose. His next step
    was to sow dissension amongst the great powers. As the champion of the
    smaller states he had already made France of considerable importance,
    and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span> then claimed that she too had a right to be treated as a
    great power and not as an enemy. His argument was that Europe had
    fought Napoleon and not France; that Louis <span class="smcap">XVIII.</span> was the
    legitimate monarch of France; and that any disrespect shown to him
    or his ambassadors would recoil on the heads of all other legitimate
    monarchs. He claimed that France had as much right to make her voice
    heard in the resettlement of Europe as any other country, because the
    allied monarchs had distinctly recognised that she was only to be
    thrust back into her former limits and not to be expunged from the map
    of Europe. Having made his claim good on the right of the legitimacy of
    his master to speak for France as a great power equal in all respects
    to the others, he proceeded to sow dissension among the representatives
    of the four allied monarchs. This was not a difficult thing to do, for
    the seeds of dissension had long existed. The difference he introduced
    was that in speaking as a fifth great power, and as the champion of the
    smaller states, France became the arbiter in the chief questions before
    the Congress.</p>

  <p>The division between the great powers was caused by the desire of
    Russia and Prussia for the aggrandisement of their territories. The
    Emperor Alexander wished to receive the whole of Poland. His idea,
    which was inspired by his friend, Prince Adam Czartoryski, was to
    form Poland into an independent kingdom ruled, however, by himself as
    Emperor of Russia. The Poles were to have a new Constitution based
    on that propounded in 1791, and the Czar of Russia was to be also
    King of Poland, just as in former days the Electors of Saxony had
    been Kings of Poland, but he was to be an hereditary, not an elected,
    sovereign. To form once more a united Poland, Austria and Prussia were
    to surrender their gains in the three partitions of Poland. Austria
    was to receive compensation for her loss of Galicia in Italy; Prussia
    was to be compensated for the loss of Prussian Poland by receiving
    the whole of Saxony. As it had been already arranged that Prussia was
    to receive the bulk of the Rhenish territory on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span> the left bank of the
    Rhine in addition to her great extensions of 1803, the result would be
    to make Prussia by far the greatest power in Germany. Talleyrand was
    acute enough to perceive that Lord Castlereagh did not approve of the
    extension of the influence of Russia, and that Metternich was equally
    indisposed to allow Prussia to obtain such a wholesale aggrandisement.
    Saxony had been the faithful ally of France to the very last, and
    Talleyrand felt that it would be an indelible stain on the French name
    if it were thus sacrificed. He was cordially supported in this view by
    his new master, for though the King of Saxony had been the faithful
    ally of Napoleon, Louis <span class="smcap">XVIII.</span> did not forget that his own
    mother was a Saxon princess. Working, therefore, on the feelings of
    Castlereagh and Metternich, he induced England and Austria to declare
    against the scheme of Russia and Prussia.</p>

  <p>The Emperor Alexander and Frederick William blustered loudly; they
    declared that they were in actual military possession of Poland and of
    Saxony, and that they would hold those states by force of arms against
    all comers. In answer, Talleyrand, Castlereagh, and Metternich signed
    a treaty of mutual alliance between France, England, and Austria, on
    the 3d of January 1815. By this secret treaty the three powers bound
    themselves to resist by arms the schemes of Russia and Prussia, and
    in the face of their determined opposition the Emperor Alexander gave
    way. Immediately Napoleon returned from Elba he found the draft treaty
    between the three powers on the table of Louis <span class="smcap">XVIII.</span> and at
    once sent it to Alexander. That monarch, confronted with the danger
    threatened by Napoleon’s landing in France, contented himself with
    showing the draft to Metternich and then threw it in the fire. The
    whole of this strange story is of the utmost interest; it proves not
    only the ability of Talleyrand, but the inherent strength of France.
    It is most significant that within a few months after the occupation
    of Paris by the allies for the first time France should again be
    recognised as a great power, and form the main factor in breaking up
    the cohesion of the alliance, which had been formed against her.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Secret Treaty of 3d Jan. 1815</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Treaty of Ghent. Dec. 24, 1814.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Settlement of Saxony.</div>

  <p>The result of Talleyrand’s skilful policy was thus to unite England,
    Austria, and France, supported by many of the secondary states, such
    as Bavaria and Spain, against the pretensions of Prussia and Russia.
    Powerful armies were immediately set on foot. France in particular
    raised her military forces from 130,000 to 200,000 men, and her new
    army was in every way superior to that with which Napoleon had fought
    his defensive campaigns in 1814, for it contained the veteran soldiers
    who had been blockaded in the distant fortresses or had been prisoners
    of war. England too was enabled to make adequate preparations, for on
    December the 24th, 1814, a treaty had been signed at Ghent between the
    United States and England which put an end to the war which had been
    proceeding ever since 1812 on account of England’s naval pretensions.
    Bavaria also promised to put in the field 30,000 men for every 100,000
    supplied by Austria. Although the secret treaty of January 3d was not
    divulged until after the return of Napoleon from Elba, the determined
    attitude of the opposition caused the Emperor Alexander to give way.
    It was decided that instead of the whole of Saxony, Prussia should
    only receive the district of Lusatia, together with the towns of
    Torgau and Wittenberg; a territory which embraced half the area of
    Saxony and one-third of its population. The King of Saxony, who had
    been treated as a prisoner of war, and whom the Emperor of Russia had
    even threatened to send to Siberia, was released from captivity, and
    induced by the Duke of Wellington, who succeeded Lord Castlereagh as
    English plenipotentiary in February 1815, to agree to these terms.
    The salvation of Saxony was a matter of great gratification to Louis
    <span class="smcap">XVIII.</span>, who remembered that though the king had been the
    faithful ally of Napoleon, he was also his own near relative.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Settlement of Poland.</div>

  <p>Since Prussia was obliged to give up her claim to the whole of Saxony,
    Russia also had to withdraw from her scheme of uniting the whole of
    Poland. Nevertheless, Russia retained the lion’s share of the Grand
    Duchy of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span> Warsaw; in 1774 her frontier had reached the Dwina and the
    Dnieper; in 1793 she obtained half of Lithuania as far as Wilna; in
    1795 she annexed the rest of Lithuania and touched the Niémen and the
    Bug; in 1809 Napoleon had granted her the territory containing the
    sources of the Bug; and now in 1815 her borders crossed the Vistula,
    and by the annexation of the Grand Duchy of Warsaw, including that
    city, penetrated for some distance between Eastern Prussia and Galicia.
    Prussia received back its share of the two first partitions of Poland,
    with the addition of the province of Posen and the city of Thorn, but
    lost Warsaw and its share in the last partition; while Austria received
    Cracow, which was to be administered as a free city. Alexander was
    deeply disappointed by the frustration of his Polish schemes, but he
    nevertheless kept his promise to Prince Adam Czartoryski and granted a
    representative constitution and a measure of independence to Russian
    Poland.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Germanic Confederation.</div>

  <p>Though the great diplomatic struggle arose over the combined question
    of Saxony and Poland, the most important work of the Congress was
    not confined to it alone. Committees were appointed to make new
    arrangements for Germany, Switzerland, Italy, and to settle other
    miscellaneous questions. Of these committees the most important was
    that which reorganised Germany. It had been arranged by the secret
    articles of the Treaty of Paris that a Germanic Confederation should
    take the place of the Holy Roman Empire. The example of Napoleon and
    his institution of the Confederation of the Rhine was followed and
    developed. Instead of the hundreds of small states which had existed
    at the commencement of the French Revolution, Germany, apart from
    Austria and Prussia, was organised into only thirty-eight states. These
    were the four kingdoms of Hanover, Bavaria, Würtemburg, and Saxony;
    the seven grand duchies of Baden, Oldenburg, Mecklenburg-Schwerin,
    Mecklenburg-Strelitz, Hesse-Cassel, Hesse-Darmstadt, and Saxe-Weimar;
    the nine duchies of Nassau, Brunswick, Saxe-Gotha,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span> Saxe-Coburg,
    Saxe-Meiningen, Saxe-Hildburghausen, Anhalt-Dessau, Anhalt-Bernburg,
    and Anhalt-Köthen; eleven principalities, two of Schwartzburg, two of
    Hohenzollern, two of Lippe, two of Reuss, Hesse-Homburg, Liechtenstein,
    and Waldeck, and the four free cities of Hamburg, Frankfort, Bremen,
    and Lübeck. The number of thirty-eight was made up by the duchies of
    Holstein and Lauenburg, belonging to the King of Denmark, and the grand
    duchy of Luxembourg, granted to the King of the Netherlands. In its
    organisation the Germanic Confederation resembled the Confederation
    of the Rhine. The Diet of the Confederation was to be always presided
    over by Austria and was to consist of two Chambers. The Ordinary
    Assembly was composed of seventeen members, one for each of the larger
    states, one for the free cities combined, one for Brunswick, one for
    Nassau, one for the four duchies of Saxony united, one for the three
    duchies of Anhalt united, and one for the smaller principalities. This
    Assembly was to sit permanently at Frankfort and to settle all ordinary
    matters. In addition there was to be a General Assembly to be summoned
    intermittently for important subjects, consisting of sixty-nine
    members returned by the different states in proportion to their size
    and population. Each state was to be supreme in internal matters, but
    private wars against each other were forbidden as well as external wars
    by individual states on powers outside the limits of the Confederacy.
    In the territorial arrangements of the new Confederation, the most
    important point is the disappearance of all ecclesiastical states. The
    Prince-Primacy, which Napoleon had established in his Confederation of
    the Rhine, was not maintained, and Dalberg, who had filled that office
    throughout the Empire, was restricted to his ecclesiastical functions.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Territorial arrangements on the Rhine.</div>

  <p>The most difficult problem to be decided was the final disposition of
    the districts on the left bank of the Rhine, which had been ruled by
    France ever since 1794. It had been settled by the secret articles at
    Paris that these dominions should be used for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span> establishment of
    strong powers upon the borders of France. The main difficulty was as
    to the disposition of the important border fortresses of Mayence and
    Luxembourg. Prussia laid claim to both these places, but was strongly
    resisted by Austria, France, and the smaller states of Germany. It was
    eventually resolved that Prussia should receive the northern territory
    on the left bank of the Rhine, stretching from Elten to Coblentz, and
    including Cologne, Trèves, and Aix-la-Chapelle. In compensation for
    the Tyrol and Salzburg, which she was forced to return to Austria, and
    in recognition of her former sovereignty in the Palatinate, Bavaria
    was granted a district from the Prussian borders to Alsace, including
    Mayence, which was designated Rhenish Bavaria. Finally, Luxembourg was
    formed into a grand duchy, and given as a German state to the House
    of Orange. It was not united to the new kingdom of the Netherlands,
    which was formed out of Holland and Belgium, but was to retain its
    independence under the sovereignty of the King of the Netherlands. The
    union of the provinces of the Netherlands was one of the favourite
    schemes of England, and was carried into effect in spite of the
    well-known feeling of opposition between the Catholic provinces of
    Belgium and the Protestant provinces of Holland.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Switzerland.</div>

  <p>As in its reorganisation of Germany, so in the settlement of
    Switzerland, the Congress of Vienna followed the example set by
    Napoleon. The Emperor had quite given up the idea which had fascinated
    the French Directory of forming Switzerland into a Republic, one
    and indivisible. He had yielded to the wishes of the Swiss people
    themselves, and organised them on the basis of a confederation of
    independent cantons. The Congress of Vienna continued Napoleon’s
    policy of forbidding the existence of subject cantons in spite of
    the protests of the Canton of Berne. Napoleon’s cantons of Argau,
    Thurgau, Saint-Gall, the Grisons, the Ticino, and the Pays de Vaud were
    maintained, but the number of the cantons was raised from nineteen to
    twenty-two by the formation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span> of the three new cantons of Geneva, the
    Valais, and Neufchâtel, which had formed part of the French Empire.
    The Canton of Berne received in reply to its importunities the greater
    part of the former Bishopric of Basle. The Swiss Confederation as
    thus constituted was placed under the guarantee of the great powers
    and declared neutral for ever. The Helvetic Constitution, which was
    promulgated by a Federal Act dated the 7th of April 1815, was not quite
    so liberal as Napoleon’s Constitution. Greater independence was secured
    in that the constitutions of the separate cantons and organic reforms
    in them had not to be submitted to the Federal Diet. The prohibition
    against internal custom houses was removed. The presidency of the
    Diet was reserved to Zurich, Berne, and Lucerne alternately, and the
    Helvetic Diet became a Congress of Delegates like the Germanic Diet
    rather than a Legislative Assembly. It is to be noted that in spite of
    the declaration of the Congress of Vienna, Prussia refused to renounce
    her claims on her former territory of Neufchâtel, the independence of
    which as a Swiss canton was not recognised by her until 1857.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Italy.</div>

  <p>The resettlement of Italy presented more than one special problem. The
    most difficult of these to solve was caused by the engagements entered
    into by the allies with Murat in 1814. Talleyrand, on behalf of the
    King of France, insisted on the dethronement and expulsion of Murat,
    while Metternich from friendship for Caroline Murat wished to retain
    him in his kingdom. The Emperor Alexander, whoever prided himself on
    his fidelity to his engagements, wished to protect Murat, and had
    at Vienna struck up a warm friendship with Eugène de Beauharnais,
    Napoleon’s Viceroy of Italy. Murat, ungrateful though he was personally
    toward Napoleon, had yet imbibed his master’s ideas in favour of the
    unity and independence of Italy. During the campaign of 1814, he had
    led his army to the banks of the Po, and he persisted in remaining
    there after the Congress of Vienna had met. But the diplomatists at
    Vienna had no wish to accept the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span> idea of Italian unity. Murat’s
    aspirations in this direction were most annoying to them, and it was
    with real pleasure that they heard after the landing of Napoleon from
    Elba that Murat had by an indiscreet proclamation given them an excuse
    for an open declaration of war. The Duke di Campo-Chiaro, Murat’s
    representative at Vienna, had kept him informed of the differences
    between the allied powers, and an indiscreet note asking whether he was
    to be considered as at peace or at war with the House of Bourbon gave
    the plenipotentiaries their opportunity. War was immediately declared
    against him; an Austrian army defeated him at Tolentino on the 3d
    of May 1815, and he was forced to fly from Italy. The acceptance of
    Murat’s ambassador, who spoke in his name as King of the Two Sicilies,
    made it difficult for the Congress to know how to treat with Ruffo
    who had been sent as ambassador by Ferdinand, the Bourbon King of the
    Two Sicilies, who had maintained his power in the island of Sicily
    through the presence of the English garrison. Acting on the ground
    of legitimacy, it was difficult to reject Ferdinand’s claims, which
    were warmly supported by France and Spain, but Murat’s ill-considered
    behaviour solved the difficulty, and after his defeat Ferdinand was
    recognised as King of the Two Sicilies. Murat, later in the year,
    landed in his former dominions, but he was taken prisoner and promptly
    shot.</p>

  <p>Another Italian question which presented considerable difficulty was
    the disposal of Genoa and the surrounding territory. When Lord William
    Bentinck occupied that city, he had in the name of England promised
    it independence and even hinted at the unity of Italy. Castlereagh
    unfortunately felt it to be his duty to disavow Bentinck’s declaration,
    and Genoa was united to Piedmont as part of the kingdom of Sardinia.
    The third difficult question was the creation of a state for the
    Empress Marie Louise. An independent sovereignty had been promised to
    her. She was naturally supported by her father, the Emperor Francis
    of Austria, and was ably represented at Vienna by her future husband,
    Count<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span> Neipperg. It was eventually resolved that she should receive the
    duchies of Parma, Piacenza, and Guastalla, but the succession was not
    secured to her son, the King of Rome, but was granted to the rightful
    heir, the King of Etruria, who, until the succession fell in, was to
    rule at Lucca. The other arrangements in Italy were comparatively
    simple. Austria received the whole of Venetia and Lombardy, in the
    place of Mantua and the Milanese, which she had possessed before 1789.
    The Grand Duchy of Tuscany, with the principality of Piombino, was
    restored to the Grand Duke Ferdinand, the uncle of the Emperor Francis
    of Austria, with the eventual succession to the Duchy of Lucca. The
    Pope received back his dominions including the Legations of Bologna and
    Ferrara, and Duke Francis, the grandson of Hercules <span class="smcap">III.</span>, was
    recognised as Duke of Modena, to which duchy he would have succeeded
    had not Napoleon absorbed it in his kingdom of Italy.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Other States.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Sweden.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Denmark.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Spain.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Portugal.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">England.</div>

  <p>The arrangements with regard to the other states of Europe made at
    the Congress of Vienna were comparatively unimportant, and did not
    present the same difficult problems as the resettlement of Germany,
    Switzerland, and Italy. Norway in spite of its disinclination was
    definitely ceded to Sweden, but Bernadotte had to restore to France the
    West-Indian island of Guadeloupe, which had been handed over to him
    by England in 1813, as part of the price of his alliance. Denmark had
    by the Treaty of Kiel with Bernadotte been promised Swedish Pomerania
    in the place of Norway. This promise was not carried out. Denmark
    like Saxony had been too faithful an ally of Napoleon not to be made
    to suffer. Swedish Pomerania was given to Prussia, and Denmark only
    received the small Duchy of Lauenburg. By these arrangements both
    Sweden and Denmark were greatly weakened, and the Scandinavian States,
    by the loss of Finland and Pomerania, surrendered to their powerful
    neighbours, Prussia and Russia, the command of the Baltic Sea. Spain,
    owing to the ability of the Count of Labrador,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span> and the support of
    Talleyrand, not only lost nothing except the island of Trinidad, which
    had been conquered by England, but was allowed to retain the district
    round Olivenza, which had been ceded to her by Portugal in 1801. The
    desertion of Portugal by England in this particular is the chief blot
    on Lord Castlereagh’s policy at Vienna. The Portuguese army had fought
    gallantly with Wellington, and there was no reason why she should have
    been forced to consent to the definite cession of Olivenza to Spain
    when other countries were winning back their former borders. Portugal
    was also made to surrender French Guiana and Cayenne to France.
    England, though she had borne the chief pecuniary stress of the war
    and had been more instrumental than any other power in overthrowing
    Napoleon, received less compensation than any other country. She kept
    Malta, thus settling the question which led to the rupture of the
    Peace of Amiens; she received Heligoland, which was ceded to her by
    Denmark, as commanding the mouth of the Elbe; and she was also granted
    the protectorate of the Ionian Islands, which enabled her to close
    the Adriatic. Among colonial possessions England took from France the
    Mauritius, Tobago, and Saint Lucia, but she returned Martinique and the
    Isle of Bourbon, and forced Sweden and Portugal to restore Guadeloupe
    and French Guiana. With regard to Holland, England retained Ceylon and
    the Cape of Good Hope, but she restored Java, Curaçao, and the other
    Dutch possessions. In the West Indies also, she retained, as has been
    said, the former Spanish island of Trinidad.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Slave Trade.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">The Navigation of Rivers.</div>

  <p>One reason for Castlereagh’s moderation at Vienna is to be found
    in the pressure that was exerted upon him in England to secure the
    abolition of the slave trade. It is a curious fact that while the
    English plenipotentiary was taking such an important share in the
    resettlement of Europe, the English people were mainly interested in
    the question of the slave trade. The great changes which were leading
    to new combinations in Europe, the aggrandisement of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span> Prussia, the
    reconstitution of Germany, the extension of Austria, all passed without
    notice, but meetings, in Lord Castlereagh’s own words, were held in
    nearly every village to insist upon his exerting his authority to
    abolish the trade in negro slaves. Castlereagh therefore lent his
    best efforts, in obedience to his constituents, to this end. The
    other ambassadors could not understand why he troubled so much about
    what seemed to them a trivial matter. They suspected a deep design,
    and thought that the reason of England’s humanity was that her West
    Indian colonies were well stocked with negroes, whereas the islands
    she was restoring were empty of them. The plenipotentiaries of other
    powers possessing colonies in the tropics therefore refused to comply
    with Castlereagh’s request and it was eventually settled that the
    slave trade should be abolished by France after five, and by Spain
    after eight years. Castlereagh had to be content with this concession,
    but to satisfy his English constituents he got a declaration condemning
    the slave trade assented to by all the powers at the Congress. Another
    point of great importance which was settled at the Congress of Vienna
    was with regard to the navigation of rivers which flow through more
    than one state. It had been the custom for all the petty sovereigns to
    impose such heavy tolls on river traffic that such rivers as the Rhine
    were made practically useless for commerce. This question was discussed
    by a committee at the Congress, and a code for the international
    regulation of rivers was drawn up and generally agreed to.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Close of the Congress of Vienna. June 1815.</div>

  <p>These matters took long to discuss, and might have taken longer had
    not the news arrived at the beginning of March 1815 that Napoleon had
    left Elba and become once more undisputed ruler of France. In the month
    of February the Duke of Wellington had succeeded Lord Castlereagh as
    English representative at Vienna, for the latter nobleman had to return
    to London to take his place in Parliament. At the news of the striking
    event of Napoleon’s being once more at the head of a French army<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span> all
    jealousies at Vienna ceased for the time. The Duke of Wellington was
    taken into consultation by the allied monarchs, and it was resolved
    to carry into effect the provisions of the Treaty of Chaumont. The
    great armies which had been prepared for a struggle amongst themselves
    were now turned by the allies against France. A treaty of alliance
    was signed at Vienna between Austria, Russia, Prussia, and England,
    on the 25th of March 1815, by which those powers promised to furnish
    180,000 men each for the prosecution of war, and stipulated that
    none of them should lay down arms until the power of Napoleon was
    completely destroyed. It was arranged that three armies should invade
    France, the first of 250,000 Austrians, Russians, and Bavarians under
    Schwartzenberg across the Upper Rhine, the second of 150,000 Prussians
    under Blücher across the Lower Rhine, and the third of 150,000 English,
    Hanoverians and Dutch from the Netherlands. Subsidies to the extent of
    £11,000,000 were promised by England to the allies. These arrangements
    made, the allied monarchs and their ministers left Vienna. But the
    final general Act of the Congress was not drawn up and signed until the
    8th of June 1815, ten days before the battle of Waterloo.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The First Reign of Louis XVIII.</div>

  <p>It has been said that the allied armies after the abdication of
    Napoleon at Fontainebleau had retired and left France to the rule of
    Louis <span class="smcap">XVIII.</span> That King on returning to France had made most
    liberal promises in the declaration known as the Declaration of Saint
    Ouen. These principles were embodied in a Charter, which was granted on
    the 4th of June 1814. By this Charter representative institutions and
    entire individual liberty were promised, and also the maintenance of
    the administrative creations of the Empire. Under the new Constitution
    there were to be two chambers, the one of hereditary peers, the other
    of elected representatives. The promises of the Charter were very fair,
    and had they been duly carried out, France might have been entirely
    contented, but unfortunately for himself Louis <span class="smcap">XVIII.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span></span> had not
    learned experience in his exile. In spite of the Charter he regarded
    himself as a ruler by right divine. <i>Emigrés</i>, even <i>émigrés</i> who had
    borne arms against France and consistently abused their fatherland,
    were promoted to the highest offices in the State. The King surrounded
    himself with reactionary courtiers, and what was worse with reactionary
    ministers. The favour shown to returned <i>émigrés</i>, the haughty attitude
    of the Princes of the blood, and the violent proclamations of the
    returned bishops and clergy made the people of France fear that the
    promises made in the Charter were but a sham, and that the next step
    would be that the estates of the Church and of the Crown which had been
    sold during the Revolution would be resumed. The feeling of distrust
    was universal. The rule of Louis <span class="smcap">XVIII.</span> had been accepted
    only as a guarantee of peace. It was never popular, and the former
    subordinates of Napoleon began to regret the Imperial <i>régime</i>. If
    this was the feeling among the civil population, it was still more
    keenly felt in the army. Prisoners of war, and the blockaded garrisons,
    who had returned to France, felt sure that Napoleon’s defeat in 1814
    had been but accidental and wished to try conclusions once more with
    Europe. In all ranks a desire was expressed to wipe out the disgrace of
    the occupation of Paris by the allies.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Napoleon’s return from Elba. March, 1815.</div>

  <p>On the 1st of March 1815, Napoleon, who had been informed of the
    universal feeling in France, landed in the Gulf of San Juan, and began
    the short reign which is known as the Hundred Days. He was accompanied
    by the 800 men of the Guard whom he had been allowed to have at Elba,
    and was received with the utmost enthusiasm by all classes. His journey
    through France was a triumphal procession. The King’s brother, the
    Comte d’Artois, vainly attempted to organise resistance at Lyons.
    Marshal Ney, who had promised to arrest his patron, joined him with the
    army under his command on the 17th of March, and on the 20th Napoleon
    re-entered Paris and took up his quarters at the Tuileries. Louis
    <span class="smcap">XVIII.</span> had fled on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span> news of Ney’s defection, and escaping
    from France took shelter at Ghent. Napoleon had learnt bitter lessons
    from his misfortunes. He declared that he would grant full and complete
    individual liberty, and also the freedom of the press, and on the 23d
    of April he promulgated what he called the Additional Act consecrating
    these principles. He felt his error in depending too entirely upon his
    bureaucracy, and he appealed on the ground of patriotism to the men
    of the Revolution whom he had in the days of his power carefully kept
    from office. These men rallied round him, and he appointed their most
    noteworthy representative, Carnot, his Minister of the Interior. He
    declared his acceptance of the two chambers ordained by the Charter,
    and most of the peers created by Louis <span class="smcap">XVIII.</span> took the oath of
    allegiance once again to Napoleon.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Campaign of Waterloo. June 1815.</div>

  <p>After rousing national enthusiasm by appeals to patriotism and by
    the liberal provisions of the Additional Act, Napoleon organised
    his army, and in his favourite fashion decided to strike before any
    invasion of France took place. Of the three armies prepared for the
    invasion the one nearest within reach was that commanded by the Duke
    of Wellington. That General on leaving Vienna had been placed at the
    head of a miscellaneous force of English, Hanoverians, Dutch, and
    Belgians. He greatly regretted the absence of most of his veterans of
    the Peninsula who were still in America, and complained of the number
    of raw troops under his command. He agreed to act in harmony with the
    Prussians under Blücher, who brought his army into the Netherlands.
    Napoleon determined to strike before Wellington and Blücher had united.
    He crossed the frontier at the head of 130,000 men, and by his skilful
    and rapid movements practically surprised the allied generals. On the
    16th of June 1815, he defeated Blücher at Ligny, while Ney with his
    left fought a drawn battle with the English advanced divisions at
    Quatre Bras. By these engagements the English and Prussian armies were
    separated. Napoleon then resolved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span> to attack the English with the bulk
    of his army, and detached Marshal Grouchy to pursue the Prussians.
    Blücher, however, promised to come to Wellington’s assistance if the
    English were attacked, and Wellington relying on this promise took up
    his position at Waterloo. On the 18th of June the battle of Waterloo
    was fought. The English army held its position in spite of repeated and
    furious attacks, until Blücher came up on the French right. Unable to
    continue the struggle against two foes, the French army was obliged to
    give way, and after the repulse of the Guard, which might have covered
    his retreat, Napoleon recognised that he was completely routed. He fled
    to Paris, and on the 22d of June he abdicated in favour of his son, the
    King of Rome. He nominated an executive commission of government, and
    then went on board ship in the hope of escaping to America. In this
    project he failed, and on 15th July he surrendered to Captain Maitland
    on board H.M.S. <i>Bellerophon</i>. The army of Wellington and Blücher
    pursued the defeated foe, but the rout had been too complete for the
    French to make another stand. Cambrai the only place that attempted to
    resist was easily taken, and on the 3d of July Wellington and Blücher
    reoccupied Paris. Meanwhile the grand army of Schwartzenberg had also
    invaded France, and the country was once more in the possession of the
    allies.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Second Treaty of Paris. 20th Nov. 1815.</div>

  <p>The terms of the second Treaty of Paris proved that the allied monarchs
    understood the difference between the opposition made by France
    to Europe in 1814 and 1815. In 1814 the Treaty of Paris which was
    then concluded was, if not particularly liberal to France, at least
    perfectly just. The allied monarchs and their ministers had appreciated
    the fact that in 1814 they were fighting Napoleon and not France. The
    campaign of 1815 had been of a different character. The French nation
    and not merely the French army had given proof of their attachment both
    to the Empire and to Napoleon’s person. It was therefore considered
    necessary, not only to impose harsher terms upon France, but to exact
    securities for the future.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span> Several schemes were proposed, of which one
    was to detach Alsace, Lorraine, and French Flanders, if not the whole
    of Picardy, and to reduce the limits of France to what they were before
    the conquests of Louis <span class="smcap">XIV.</span> This scheme, which was earnestly
    supported by Prussia, who hoped to get the lion’s share of the
    districts taken from France, was warmly opposed by Austria and England.
    The latter power was not to be bribed by the proposed extension of
    the frontier of its new creation, the Kingdom of the Netherlands. And
    the former objected entirely to any increase of the power of Prussia.
    Lord Castlereagh in his opposition to these extravagant suggestions
    of Prussia was supported by the Emperor Alexander and his minister,
    Nesselrode, and eventually it was agreed that France should be
    reduced to its exact limits of 1789. This meant that France lost all
    the cessions made to it in 1814, except Avignon and the Venaissin.
    Chambéry and the part of Savoy then granted to France were restored
    to the King of Sardinia; the districts in the neighbourhood of Geneva
    were also returned to that canton, and the fortress of Huningen on the
    borders of Switzerland was ordered to be dismantled; and the various
    rectifications of the frontier on the eastern and north-eastern borders
    were no longer sanctioned. A war contribution of 700,000,000 francs was
    laid upon France, in addition to which she was to maintain, at the cost
    of 250,000,000 francs a year, an army of 150,000 men in the possession
    of her chief frontier fortresses for a period of five years.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Napoleon sent to St. Helena.</div>

  <p>These were the most important conditions of peace contained in the
    second Treaty of Paris, which was signed on 20th of November 1815. But
    what France felt more bitterly than pecuniary contributions, or even
    the loss of territory, was the decision of the allied powers that the
    numerous pictures and works of art, which had been accumulated in Paris
    during the wars of the Revolution and the Empire, should be returned to
    their former owners. The Prussians were not satisfied with this, they
    wished to punish Paris more severely. Blücher was only prevented by
    the intervention of Lord Castlereagh and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span> the Duke of Wellington from
    exacting a contribution of a 110,000,000 francs from the inhabitants of
    Paris alone. The Prussians even made preparations to blow up the Bridge
    of Jena, whose name perpetuated their greatest military humiliation,
    and were only prevented from their purpose by the expressed
    determination of Louis <span class="smcap">XVIII.</span> to stand upon the bridge and be
    blown up with it if they persisted, and Blücher had to be satisfied
    with the alteration of the name of the bridge from the Bridge of Jena
    to the Bridge of the Military School. The question of the disposition
    of the person of Napoleon was one of some difficulty. He reached Torbay
    on board the <i>Bellerophon</i> on the 24th of July 1815, and the English
    Ministers did not know what to do with their illustrious prisoner. They
    dared not trust him in any part of Europe or America from which he
    could repeat his expedition from Elba. Blücher loudly declared that he
    ought to be shot at Vincennes like the Duc d’Enghien, but the English
    Government thought it would be sufficient to confine him on an isolated
    island. For this purpose they borrowed the island of Saint Helena from
    the East India Company, and on the 8th of August, Napoleon set sail for
    his place of exile on board H.M.S. <i>Northumberland</i>.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Holy Alliance. Sept. 1815</div>

  <p>A month after the departure of Napoleon for St. Helena, the Emperor
    Alexander, the Emperor Francis, and King Frederick William signed the
    treaty which is known as the Holy Alliance. By this treaty it was
    declared that the Christian religion was the sole base of government,
    and the contracting monarchs promised to aid each other on all
    occasions like brothers, and to recommend to their peoples the exercise
    of the duties of the Christian religion. Lord Castlereagh declined
    on behalf of the Prince Regent to join the Holy Alliance, but on the
    28th of November 1815, after the signature of the Peace of Paris, he
    agreed to an alliance that should include all the four powers, of which
    the aims were to keep from the throne of France either Napoleon or
    any relation of his, to combine together for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span> security of their
    separate states, and the general tranquillity of Europe, and to hold at
    fixed dates congresses for the settlement of disputed questions.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Second Restoration of Louis XVIII. July 1815.</div>

  <p>The second restoration of Louis <span class="smcap">XVIII.</span> differed from the first
    as the second Treaty of Paris differed from its predecessor. After
    the events of the Hundred Days, the Bourbon King could no more delude
    himself with the idea that he was welcome to the people of France.
    He owed his seat upon the throne only to the absence of Napoleon and
    the presence of the allied armies in France, and he prepared on this
    occasion to punish those who had deserted him. He refused to grant an
    amnesty, and on the 24th of July 1815, he proscribed fifty-seven of
    the leading men in France, of whom nineteen were ordered to be tried
    by court-martial, and thirty-eight were banished. The most illustrious
    of the victims who perished under this proscription was Marshal Ney,
    who was shot at Paris on the 7th of December, after being condemned to
    death by the Chamber of Peers. This procedure was rendered necessary
    because it would have been difficult to find a court-martial to condemn
    the bravest of the French marshals. Marshal Moncey, who was nominated
    to preside over such a court-martial, refused in an eloquent letter
    which caused him to be sent to prison for three months. Far worse than
    these executions was the result of the outbreak of brigandage in the
    south of France. Under the pretext of being Royalists, the Companies
    of Jehu, which had ravaged the south of France in the days of the
    Thermidorians and of the Directory, again set to work. Political,
    religious, and personal passions excited to massacre. Pillage and
    murder were rife throughout the south of France, and among the victims
    who were slain in this White Terror of 1815 were Marshal Brune, and
    Generals Ramel and Lagarde. Special courts were formed by a law
    voted on the 12th of December 1815, to punish political offences.
    These provost’s courts were as severe and almost as unjust as the
    revolutionary tribunals in the provinces during the Reign of Terror,
    and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span> many hundreds of executions took place. Finally, in January 1816,
    what was ironically called a Law of Amnesty was passed. This law, from
    the list of its exceptions, was practically a gigantic proscription.
    Among others, all surviving members of the Convention who had voted for
    the death of Louis <span class="smcap">XVI.</span> were exiled if they had in any way
    accepted the authority of Napoleon during the Hundred Days, which most
    of them had done. Under this Law of Amnesty most of the great statesmen
    who had been concerned in the government of France since 1793 were
    driven into exile. Conspicuous among them were Carnot, Merlin of Douai,
    Sieyès, Cambacérès, and David, the greatest painter of his time.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Government of the Second Restoration.</div>

  <p>Restored for a second time to the throne of France, Louis
    <span class="smcap">XVIII.</span> declined to take warning from the result of his
    former policy. He again showered his favours on returned <i>émigrés</i>,
    and pursued a thoroughly reactionary policy. As soon as he was firmly
    seated at the Tuileries, with the Prussians and the English encamped
    round Paris, he dismissed Talleyrand and Fouché from office and formed
    a new and strongly Royalist ministry under the presidency of the Duc
    de Richelieu, who had spent the last twenty years of his life in
    exile as one of the chief administrators of Russia. The king avowed
    his intention of keeping the promises he made in the Charter of 1814,
    but those promises were carried out in such a way as to make them
    absolutely illusory. He took advantage of the general adhesion given
    to Napoleon on his return from Elba to exclude from the Upper Chamber
    or House of Peers most of the leading men in France, leaving the
    majority entirely in the hands of former <i>émigrés</i>, and of men who by
    the excess of their royalism wished to palliate their offence in not
    having emigrated. The Lower House, or Chamber of Representatives, even
    exceeded the House of Peers in its violent royalism. The deputies,
    chiefly elected under the direct pressure of threats of vengeance,
    were ready to adopt any reactionary measure suggested to them.
    Louis <span class="smcap">XVIII.</span> gave this Assembly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span> the name of the ‘Chambre
    Introuvable,’ which he intended as a compliment, but which has survived
    as a term of derision. Among the first laws voted were the suspension
    of individual liberty, and of the liberty of the press, and the request
    was then made that the King, in his goodness, would revise fourteen
    articles of the Charter which were too liberal. But even this chamber,
    aided by the presence of foreign armies, could not make France revert
    to the condition in which it had been before 1789. A hint of the
    resumption of ecclesiastical or national domains would have set the
    whole country in an uproar, and the Chamber had to be satisfied with
    voting a large sum of money out of the ordinary taxes as compensation
    to the <i>émigrés</i> for their sufferings in exile.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Reaction in Spain.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">Naples.</div>

  <p>The spirit of reaction went much further in Spain than in France.
    Ferdinand <span class="smcap">VII.</span>, on returning to his capital in May 1814,
    issued a proclamation attacking the Cortes, which had done so much to
    recover the country from the hands of the French. In his own words:
    ‘A Cortes convoked in a manner never before known in Spain has been
    profiting by my captivity in France, and has usurped my rights by
    imposing on my people an anarchical and seditious Constitution based on
    the democratic principles of the French Revolution.’ The King of Spain
    then proceeded to annul by his own absolute authority everything that
    had been done during his absence. He re-established the Inquisition,
    and proscribed and condemned to death all who had taken part in
    reforming the institutions of Spain, whether under the authority of
    Joseph Bonaparte or under that of the National Cortes. Many hundreds,
    if not thousands, of Spanish patriots were put to death in a vain
    attempt of Ferdinand <span class="smcap">VII.</span> to restore things as they had been
    in former days. The attempt to carry out a complete reaction resulted
    in utter failure. Insurrections broke out in all directions, and the
    Spanish colonies in South America took advantage of the troubles in the
    fatherland to strike a blow for their own freedom. It is satisfactory
    to be able to state that the head of the third reigning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span> branch of the
    House of Bourbon behaved with more moderation and wisdom than Ferdinand
    <span class="smcap">VII.</span> of Spain or Louis <span class="smcap">XVIII.</span> of France. Ferdinand
    <span class="smcap">IV.</span>, King of the Two Sicilies, returned to his capital at
    Naples in June 1815. He can hardly be blamed for ordering the execution
    of Murat whom he had always regarded as a usurper, and it is greatly
    to his credit that he made some endeavour to retain the excellent
    administration on the French system which had been established by
    Joseph Bonaparte and Murat.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Results of the Congress of Vienna.</div>

  <p>The final overthrow of Napoleon and his exile to St. Helena allowed the
    new system for the government of Europe as laid down by the Congress
    of Vienna to be tried. That system may be roughly designated as the
    system of the Great Powers. Before 1789, certain states, such as
    France and England and Spain, were, from fortuitous circumstances, or
    the course of their history, larger, more united, and therefore more
    fitted for war, than others, but the greater part of the Continent
    was split up into small, and in the case of Germany, into very small
    states. Several of these small states, such as Sweden and Holland,
    had at different times exercised a very considerable influence, and
    the policy of Frederick the Great had added another to them, in the
    military state of Prussia. At the Congress of Vienna the tendency
    was to diminish the number and power of the secondary states, and to
    destroy minute sovereignties. Sweden and Denmark were relegated to the
    rank of third-rate powers; the petty principalities of Germany were
    built up into third-rate states. Austria and Prussia were established
    as great powers, but the increase of their territory brought with it
    dissimilar results. Prussia became the preponderant state of Germany,
    while Austria, whose Imperial House had so long held the position
    of Holy Roman Emperor, became less German, and now depended for its
    strength on its Italian, Magyar, and Slavonic provinces. The irruption
    of Russia into the European comity of nations was another significant
    feature. By its annexation of the greater part of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span> the Grand Duchy of
    Warsaw, Russia thrust itself between Prussia and Austria territorially,
    while its leading share in the overthrow of Napoleon made its place as
    a European power unassailable. It may be doubted if the policy of Peter
    the Great and the Empress Catherine was thus carried out. The tendency
    of those rulers was to make the Baltic and the Black Sea Russian lakes,
    and to build up an Empire of the East; affairs in Central Europe only
    interested them in so far as they prevented interference with their
    Eastern designs, and did not lead to the erection of powerful states on
    the Russian border.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">The Principle of Nationality.</div>

  <p>Nothing is more remarkable in the settlement of Europe by the Congress
    of Vienna than the entire neglect of the principle of nationality. Yet
    it was the sentiment of national patriotism which had enabled France to
    repulse Europe in arms, and had trained the soldiers with whom Napoleon
    had given the law to the Continent and had overthrown the mercenary
    armies of his opponents. It was the principle of nationality which had
    crippled Napoleon’s finest armies in Spain, and which had produced
    his expulsion from Russia. It was the feeling of intense national
    patriotism which had made the Prussian army of 1813, and enabled
    Prussia after its deepest humiliation to take rank as a first-class
    power. But the diplomatists at Vienna treated the idea as without
    force. They had not learnt the great lesson of the French Revolution,
    that the first result of rousing a national consciousness of political
    liberty is to create a spirit of national patriotism. The Congress of
    Vienna trampled such notions under foot. The partition of Poland was
    consecrated by Europe; Italy was placed under foreign rulers; Belgium
    and Holland, in spite of the hereditary opposition of centuries, were
    united under one king. The territories on the left bank of the Rhine,
    which were happy under French rule, and had been an integral part of
    France for twenty years, were roughly torn away, and divided between
    Prussia, Bavaria, and the House of Orange, under the fancied necessity,
    induced by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span> exploded notion of maintaining the balance of power in
    Europe, of building up a bulwark against France. Such short-sighted
    policy was certain to be undone. Holland and Belgium separated; Italy
    became united; Poland maintained the consciousness of her national
    unity, and has more than once endeavoured to regain her independence;
    France has never ceased to yearn after her ‘natural’ frontier,
    the Rhine; the states of Germany have developed a national German
    patriotism which has led to the creation of the modern German Empire.
    This feeling of conscious nationality was the result of the French
    Revolution and the wars of Napoleon; its existence is the strength of
    England, France, Russia, and Germany, its absence is the weakness of
    Austria. In so far as the spirit of nationality was neglected at the
    Congress of Vienna, its work was but temporary; in its resurrection,
    which has filled the history of the present century, the work of the
    French Revolution has been permanent.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Permanent results of the French Revolution.</div>

  <p>But after all, the growth of the spirit of nationality is only a
    secondary result of the French Revolution upon Europe; it did not
    arise in France until foreign powers attempted to interfere with the
    development of the French people after their own fashion; it did not
    arise in Europe until Napoleon began to interfere with the development
    of other nations. The primary results of the French Revolution,—the
    recognition of individual liberty, which implied the abolition of
    serfdom and of social privileges; the establishment of political
    liberty, which implied the abolition of despots, however benevolent,
    and of political privileges; the maintenance of the doctrine of the
    sovereignty of the people, which implied the right of the people,
    through their representatives, to govern themselves,—have also survived
    the Congress of Vienna. When Europe tried to interfere, the French
    people sacrificed these great gains to the spirit of nationality,
    and bowed before the despotism of the Committee of Public Safety and
    of Napoleon; they have since regained them. The French taught these
    principles to the rest of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span> Europe, and the history of Europe since 1815
    has been the history of their growth side by side with the idea of
    nationality. How the two, liberty and nationality, can be preserved in
    harmony is the great problem of the future; the history of Europe from
    1789 to 1815 affords many examples of the difficulty of the problem and
    of the dangers which beset its solution.</p>

    Europe at the beginning of 1789, after the rearrangement in 1803, at
    the height of Napoleon’s power in 1810, and according to the settlement
    made by the Congress of Vienna in 1815.</p>

  <p>The same colouring has been preserved through the series of maps in

  <p>The red line in Map 1 marks the boundary of the Holy Roman Empire.</p>

  <p>The area in Germany left uncoloured—in all four maps—was occupied by

    valued by all historical students as supplying a real want in our
    historical literature, and supplying it well.... He paints on a small
    scale, it is true, but his touch is sure and his insight keen. For

  <p>‘Though on a comparatively small scale, Mr. Oman’s sketch is complete
    and vivid. His insight and acumen in appreciating the bearing of events
    and in estimating the influence of personal character are particularly
    striking, whilst his pleasing and picturesque style makes the perusal
    of his work as enjoyable from the literary as it is instructive from
    the historical point of view.’—<b>Glasgow Herald.</b></p>

  <p>‘A high place must be assigned to the work of Mr. Oman.’—<b>Oxford Magazine.</b></p>

  <p>‘The publishers of these volumes of European History have taken in
    hand a task that is to be highly commended, since, we believe, there
    does not exist in English any series dealing continuously with such
    a subject, from the fall of the Roman Empire in the West down to our

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
